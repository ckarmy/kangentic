/**
 * Two invariants about the branch-identity columns on `tasks`, both keyed on
 * the writes that discard a LOCAL checkout.
 *
 * `resolved_base_branch` describes the checkout: the base the worktree was
 * actually cut from. It has to be discarded wherever `branch_name` is, or a
 * task whose worktree and branch were just reclaimed keeps measuring the PR
 * ladder's base-relative guards against a base it no longer sits on.
 *
 * `pushed_branch` describes the WORK, not the checkout: the remote branch the
 * work was pushed to, captured from the agent's own `git push` or by the
 * ladder's remote-tip inference. It is a remote fact that outlives the local
 * directory, and for a task with no worktree it is the ONLY PR anchor the app
 * can record. So the invariant is the opposite one: no cleanup path nulls it.
 * It used to be nulled alongside `branch_name` on the theory that a reset task
 * "no longer has any work"; `pr_number` survives every one of those paths, so
 * the reset never actually forgot the PR, and nulling `pushed_branch` only
 * stranded a task whose PR had not linked yet when the reset ran (resolver
 * down). Those paths capture `head_sha` before discarding the checkout for the
 * same reason. The one legal `pushed_branch: null` is the row insert.
 *
 * Deliberately keyed on `branch_name: null` rather than on the cleanup
 * functions: `deleteTaskWorktree` nulls `worktree_path` on the Done move but
 * PRESERVES `branch_name`, and it must preserve `resolved_base_branch` as
 * well. "Wherever the branch goes" is the correct trigger, not "wherever the
 * worktree goes".
 *
 * This is a static scan rather than a behavioural test because the sites are
 * spread across four modules with different callers, and the invariant is
 * about every write, not any one code path.
 *
 * It keys on the OCCURRENCE of `branch_name: null` and then brace-matches out to
 * the object literal containing it, rather than matching the shape of the call
 * around it. An earlier version matched `update({ ... })` with an inline literal,
 * which silently skipped the equally ordinary
 *
 *   const patch = { id, worktree_path: null, branch_name: null };
 *   tasks.update(patch);
 *
 * and skipped any nested literal too. A skipped site produced no offender AND no
 * drop in the guard-the-guard count, so both tests stayed green while the
 * invariant went unenforced. Anything this scan cannot resolve is now REPORTED
 * rather than passed over, so the failure mode is a loud "tighten the scan"
 * instead of silence.
