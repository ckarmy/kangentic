/**
 * Spawn entry-point parity guard (see .claude/rules/spawn-entry-point-parity.md).
 *
 * Every way a task agent can be spawned must route through one of the two
 * spawn chokepoints, because spawn-affecting behavior (the first-spawn
 * Advanced-override lock, agent resolution, permission-mode resolution,
 * auto_command handling) is applied there and ONLY there:
 *
 *   - board-driven spawns (task move, create-into-spawn-column, backlog
 *     promote, MCP create, unarchive) go through `spawnAgent`
 *     (src/main/ipc/helpers/agent-spawn.ts);
 *   - startup spawns (crash recovery, reconcile) go through
 *     `prepareAgentSpawn` (src/main/transition-engine/session-startup/
 *     prepare-spawn.ts).
 *
 * Both chokepoints run `runSpawnPreamble` (src/main/transition-engine/
 * spawn-preamble.ts): the lock, then agent resolution, in that order.
 *
 * This shipped as a bug: the first-spawn override lock landed in only 2 of
 * the 4 entry points that existed at the time (task-crud.ts and task-move's
 * spawnAgent call), so a task whose true first spawn happened via startup
 * recovery or unarchive never locked its overrides - and the create path
 * persisted a locked agent while the engine spawned a different one, because
 * it passed `agentOverride: undefined` and `executeSpawnAgent` never reads
 * `task.agent_override`.
 *
 * This test makes that class of drift unmergeable by pure source analysis:
 *   (a) every direct call to the engine spawn sinks (`executeTransition` /
 *       `resumeSuspendedSession`) must be in an explicitly classified file;
 *   (b) every raw PTY spawn (`sessionManager.spawn(`) must be in an
 *       explicitly classified file;
 *   (c) the chokepoints must actually contain their preamble calls, so an
 *       allowlisted file cannot silently drop the shared behavior;
 *   (d) the first-spawn lock has exactly one call site (inside the preamble),
 *       so an ad-hoc handler-level lock cannot reappear and diverge from
 *       agent-resolution ordering.
 *
 * A new entry point therefore cannot ship without a deliberate decision:
 * route it through a chokepoint, or add a justified allowlist entry here AND
 * update the rule file.
