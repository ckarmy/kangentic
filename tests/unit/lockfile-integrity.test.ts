// checking it is the same bytes anyone else got.
//
// This is not hypothetical here. Regenerating the lockfile against a populated node_modules
// silently strips `resolved` and `integrity` from every package already on disk: npm reads
// the installed version out of the on-disk package.json, which since npm 7 carries no
// `_resolved` / `_integrity`, and writes an entry with neither. Packages NOT on disk
// (wrong-platform optionals) get resolved from the registry and keep full metadata, so the
// damage is invisible unless you count. That happened in 4de7b2e9 and left 1009 of 1211
// entries unverified for two months, across every CI job and the signed release build.
//
// `npm install --package-lock-only` does not repair it (arborist will not re-fetch a manifest
// for an already-satisfied node), which is why the fix is a dedicated script.
