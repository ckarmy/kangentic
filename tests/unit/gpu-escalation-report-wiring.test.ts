/**
 * The GPU-health escalation report block inside `app.whenReady()` in
 * `src/main/index.ts`. It reads a pending escalation record (written by
 * `gpu-health.ts` once repeated GPU-process deaths cross the threshold in an
 * earlier run), clears it, and reports it via `reportHandledError`.
 *
 * `gpu-health.ts`'s own counting/latch/decay/durable-write contract is
 * covered by `tests/unit/gpu-health.test.ts`; this file only pins that the
 * report block in index.ts reads/clears/reports in the right order, sources
 * its two feature-status values from the right places, cannot disrupt
 * startup on a telemetry-only failure, and reads the escalation path from
 * one shared constant rather than a second independent literal.
 *
 * `src/main/index.ts` makes top-level `electron` calls and cannot be
 * imported by a unit test, so this is a static source scan - the same
 * constraint and approach as `tests/unit/before-quit-drain-wiring.test.ts`
 * and `tests/unit/startup-gate.test.ts`.
 *
 * Tier: Unit.
