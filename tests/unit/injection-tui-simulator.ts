/**
 * Deterministic simulator for the auto_command injection path.
 *
 * Not a test file (vitest only collects `*.test.ts`). This is the shared rig
 * used by `injection-load-rig.test.ts` to measure delivery rate, and by the
 * injection regression tests to exercise the real `TerminalSubmit` against a
 * TUI that can actually fail the way Claude Code's Ink prompt fails.
 *
 * What it models, and why each piece exists:
 *
 *  - **A slash-command picker with a render delay.** The documented
 *    regression is that `Esc` sent on a fixed 100ms delay can arrive BEFORE
 *    the picker has rendered, where it is a no-op; the picker then renders
 *    and eats the following `Enter`, leaving the command typed but never
 *    submitted. That failure needs a picker whose render takes wall-clock
 *    time, so it is modeled explicitly rather than assumed.
 *
 *  - **A prompt buffer that survives.** Text appends. This is what makes the
 *    `instead can we/pull-request` concatenation reproducible: if a draft is
 *    present and the clear does not land, the injected command glues onto it
 *    and the submission is wrong rather than missing.
 *
 *  - **Ctrl+C dropped mid-repaint.** On Windows ConPTY + Ink a Ctrl+C landing
 *    mid-render was swallowed, which is the origin of the `</task>/test` glue
 *    bug. Modeled so a fix that merely skips the clear cannot pass by
 *    accident.
 *
 *  - **An asynchronous write queue.** Real writes are enqueued and drained on
 *    a later tick, so a delay measured from enqueue is not a delay measured
 *    from the PTY. `drain()` is meaningful here, which is what lets the rig
 *    show the difference.
 *
 * Timing is real (not fake timers) but scaled small, and all randomness is
 * seeded, so runs are reproducible and the suite stays fast on CI.
