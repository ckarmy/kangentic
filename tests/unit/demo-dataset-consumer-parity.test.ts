/**
 * The sample install has TWO consumers, and a field wired into one of them reaches nobody else.
 *
 * `buildDemoPreConfig` seeds both the web demo (demo/vite.config.mts, deployed to Pages on every
 * release) and the marketing captures (tests/captures/helpers/marketing-fixture.ts, the PNGs the
 * site ships). They are built by different commands on different schedules, so a field added to one
 * call site and forgotten at the other produces two marketing artifacts that disagree, with nothing
 * failing anywhere. That nearly happened with `messageTrails`: the web demo had it first, and the
 * captures would have gone on showing task descriptions with no test to say so.
 *
 * So the two option sets are pinned against each other, and every deliberate difference is named.
 *
 * This is a STATIC scan of both call sites rather than a runtime comparison, because the web demo's
 * side lives inside a Vite config's local `buildSeedScript` and is not exported or callable here.
 * The vacuity guards below are what stop a regex that stopped matching from passing silently.
