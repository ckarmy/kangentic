 * The sample install: three projects in two groups, their boards, sessions, backlog, usage, and

 * captures (through `buildMarketingPreConfig()` in marketing-fixture.ts) and the web build
 * (demo/vite.config.mts), so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Names were chosen with the user on GitHub star and fork data (see demo/README.md): Contoso is
 * the one placeholder company developers in the Microsoft world already know, spring-petclinic
 * is the most-forked sample repo on GitHub, and Online Boutique is the cloud-native reference app.
 *
 * Every timestamp is an OFFSET from boot (`minutesAgo`), so a card reads "3 min ago" whenever the
 * frame opens; a capture that needs a fixed clock pins `Date.now` on the page.
 *
 * No Node imports on purpose: the returned script string runs inside the page against the mock,
 * and demo/vite.config.mts serializes this module into the static build.

/**
 * A label is coloured only when the colour changes what the reader does about it: something is
 * broken (red) or something is slow (amber). Everything else classifies the work rather than
 * flagging it, so it takes one muted slate and stays quiet.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a colour per label. Twelve saturated hues put seven of them on the
 * contoso board at once, which reads as decoration rather than as a team's convention, and a
 * board that looks decorated is the first thing a viewer distrusts about a demo. A new label
 * joins the slate group unless it means broken or slow.
 */
/*
 * A label carries ONE hex, and the frame ships a dark default theme and a light one (the site
 * embeds theme=sand), so each colour is judged on its WORST contrast across the two rather than on
 * how it looks in whichever was opened last. There is a hard ceiling on that: a single colour
 * cannot clear 4.5 against both a near-black and a near-white ground, because the luminance that
 * maximises the worse side lands at about 4.07 for both. So these are chosen to sit as close to
 * that ceiling as a recognizable palette step allows, and 4.5 is not reachable by any hex.
 *
 * Measured against #18181b and #faf7f2, worst of the two: defect 3.96, risk 3.92, build 3.53,
 * neutral 3.72. A colour also has to survive a SECOND test that contrast cannot see. The board
 * already means something by most of the spectrum: emerald #34d399 is a working agent, honey
 * #e3b341 is a session that needs you, the default priority badges take yellow #eab308, orange
 * #f97316 and red #ef4444, the seven swimlane accents run violet through emerald, and the usage
 * dashboard adds six chart series. A label colour landing near any of those reads as a status
 * the user then has to unlearn, so each is also scored on CIE76 distance from every one of them.
 *
 * Four candidates were rejected on that second test after passing the first, and two of them were
 * the colours this board shipped with. Red-600 for bug sat 11 from the Urgent priority badge,
 * close enough that the backlog table rendered an orange High badge and a red bug pill in one row
 * with nothing between them but the title. Amber-700 for perf sat 24 from the High badge.
 * Purple-500 sat 10 from the Planning column and cyan-600 sat 15 from the Testing column, which
 * is the pair a card sits directly beneath. Teal-600 sat 20 from the chart green and 34 from the
 * working spinner, the one confusion a board full of green activity cannot afford.
 *
 * Sweeping hue, saturation and lightness for colours that clear 3.45 on both grounds AND stay 30
 * or more from every reserved colour leaves two windows: magenta through rose, and a warm band
 * that is open only at low saturation, because every reserved colour there is a bright signal.
 * Hence a plum family at 22 percent saturation, plus one warm step from the second window.
 *
 * The family holds two steps and no more. Both grounds have to stay legible, which pins lightness
 * near 50 percent, so there is no room for a light and a dark step of one colour and hue is the
 * only axis left. At 36 percent saturation two steps sit 32 apart and read as two colours; at the
 * softness this board wants they collapse to 17, and below 28 percent no pair in the family
 * clears 26 at all. So defect and risk are deliberately siblings (17), which is the honest way to
 * show that the labels sharing them are related, while build stands apart from both (37 and 51)
 * and from neutral (36).
