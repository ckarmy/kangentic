/**
 * Drag liveness gate: while a board drag is active, session-store pushes (spawn
 * progress, activity, usage, ...) must NOT be held. The coalescer parks only
 * background reloads for the length of a gesture; a push applies immediately, so
 * an unrelated card keeps reporting while another card is dragged. What must not
 * happen is the applied push changing that card's HEIGHT, which is the one thing
 * that makes dnd-kit re-measure mid-drag.
 *
 * Asserting at the store level is the clean proxy for "applied": if the value
 * reaches the session store during the drag, the subscribed card re-rendered from
 * it. The height assertion is the guard against the re-render becoming a
 * re-measure.

/**
 * Session pushes must keep applying to OTHER cards while a board drag is in flight.
 *
 * This used to assert the opposite - that the update was withheld until the drop -
 * because the gate parked every session push for the length of the gesture. That
 * froze every agent's indicator and context bar on the board while the user dragged
 * an unrelated card, which reads as the app hanging. Agents are independent of a
 * board gesture; their reporting has to survive it.
 *
 * The hold was justified by a claim that a re-render forces dnd-kit to re-measure on
 * the pointer-move thread. It does not: droppables register in a `useEffect(...,
 * [id])` and the default measuring strategy is WhileDragging, not Always. What DOES
 * disturb a drag is a card changing HEIGHT, because dnd-kit's ResizeObserver runs
 * only while dragging and re-measures every card below the resized one. That is
 * prevented at the source instead - TaskCard's running-state spinner is structurally
 * identical to its resolved context footer, so a spawn resolving cannot grow a card.
 *
 * The spawning card is deliberately a DIFFERENT card from the dragged one: that is
 * the case dnd-kit's `updateMeasurementsFor: itemsAfterCurrentSortable` cascade
 * would hit.
