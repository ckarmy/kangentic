# Rule: a menu popover portals out of its clipping ancestors

`z-index` does not escape an ancestor's overflow clip. A dropdown rendered in flow as
`absolute top-full ... z-50` is confined to the nearest `overflow: hidden` /
`overflow-y-auto` box, no matter how high its stacking order. This shipped twice: the Labels
field of the task-detail edit form, and then the Model / Agent / Effort / Permission
comboboxes in the same form, which showed only their first two options until the user
scrolled the form. The task-detail window alone nests three `overflow-hidden` ancestors above
one `overflow-y-auto` scroller, and the settings panel body, the board manager, the Import
dialog's raw body, `PopOutWindowFrame`, and every `DataTable` cell are clipping boxes too. A
menu inside a `<td>` is clipped to roughly one 40px table row.

## The rule

A popover that presents a list of choices (a menu, listbox, or picker) renders through a
`document.body` portal, positioned with a fixed strategy:

```tsx
const { style, placement } = usePopoverPosition(triggerRef, menuRef, open, {
  mode: 'dropdown', strategy: 'fixed',
  matchTriggerWidth: true, // only for a menu that stretches to its trigger (a combobox)
});

<OverlayPopover open={open} popoverRef={menuRef} style={style} portal
  transformOrigin={placement.vertical === 'above' ? 'bottom center' : 'top center'}
  className="fixed z-[2147483646] ..." data-testid="...-menu">
```

Four things that are easy to get wrong, each of which fails silently:

- **Outside-click must check both refs.** The handler is a capture-phase `mousedown`; once the
  menu is portaled out of the trigger's subtree, a click inside it reads as "outside" and
  dismisses the menu. Check the menu ref **and** the container ref.
- **Keyboard navigation must query the menu ref**, not the container. A stale container query
  returns nothing, and since the arrow handler blurs the input first, focus lands on `<body>`
  and every subsequent key is dead.
- **`z-50` is wrong for a portaled element.** `BaseDialog` is itself `z-50`, and a body portal
  is its sibling. Use `z-[2147483646]`, as `LabelInput` and `KebabMenu` do.
- **Width and height caps do not survive.** `usePopoverPosition` writes `top`/`left`, so
  `left-0 right-0` width matching is lost: pass `matchTriggerWidth: true` and the hook writes the
  trigger's width onto the menu BEFORE it measures. Do not measure the trigger in a second
  `useLayoutEffect` and pass `width` through `style`. Layout effects run in declaration order, so
  the hook's effect fires first and measures a width-less menu on the mount commit. Its
  shrink-to-fit width is a run of inline-block `w-full` option buttons laid on ONE line (about
  1300px for 15 agents), which flips the overflow check and right-aligns the menu at
  `trigger.right - 1300`: 823px left of the Settings > Agent field, correct width, correct top.
  The width state survived the close, so only the first open per mount failed, and Settings
  remounts its comboboxes on every panel open. The same one-line measurement also reads the
  height one row tall, so the fits-below decision was made against the wrong height. Keep the
  `max-h-*` cap on the portaled element, or a tall list fits neither below nor above,
  `openAbove` fires unconditionally, and `top` goes negative.

Two properties of the pattern to know before you reach for it, both shared with the existing
portaled sites (`LabelInput`, `KebabMenu`) rather than new:

- **The position is computed once, at open.** `usePopoverPosition` has no `scroll` or `resize`
  listener, so a `fixed` menu holds its viewport coordinates while its trigger moves. Scrolling
  the settings tab body, the task-detail edit form, the board-manager body, or a `DataTable`
  while a menu is open visually detaches it. Prefer a trigger that cannot scroll under an open
  menu; the `DataTable` sites partly self-heal, because virtualizing the anchor row out unmounts
  the popover with it.
- **`z-[2147483646]` clears the toast layer too.** Toasts render at `z-[60]`
  (`ToastContainer.tsx`), so a toast that fires while a portaled menu is open renders behind it.

`mode: 'flyout'` is exempt: the hook ignores `strategy` in flyout mode, so a flyout is
positioned against its parent and must already live inside a portaled parent (as
`TaskDetailHeader`'s submenus live inside `KebabMenu`'s).

A popover with no clipping ancestor at any mount site may stay in flow with a
`popover-inflow-ok: <reason>` comment naming the mount sites that were checked.

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Test (behavior, load-bearing):** two UI specs assert the structural invariant - that the
  menu is NOT a descendant of its clipping ancestor. `tests/ui/combobox-portal-clipping.spec.ts`
  covers Combobox / FontCombobox / ModelCombobox (the task-detail edit form at a short viewport)
  and `BranchPicker`'s `variant="input"` (Settings > Git), plus that the portal did not break
  outside-click, arrow-key navigation, or trigger-width matching.
  `tests/ui/popover-clipping-promote-restore-shortcuts.spec.ts` covers PromotePopover,
  RestorePopover, and ShortcutsTab's Presets menu. The structural assertion is the real guard:
  Playwright's `boundingBox()` and `toBeVisible()` both ignore overflow clipping, so a
  geometry-only check passes against a fully clipped menu.
- **Test (shape, tripwire):** `tests/unit/popover-inflow-menu.test.ts` scans `src/renderer/**`
  with TWO checks, and fails unless the site carries `popover-inflow-ok:`. Runs in CI via
  `npm run test:unit`.
  1. A `usePopoverPosition` call in `mode: 'dropdown'` that omits `strategy: 'fixed'`. This is
     the check that covers the common shape: in the default `'absolute'` strategy the hook
     writes `top`/`bottom: 100%` imperatively, so there is no positioning class to grep for.
     `mode: 'flyout'` never trips it, since the hook ignores `strategy` there.
  2. A class string that positions in flow (`absolute` + `top-full` / `bottom-full`) AND
     scrolls or caps its own height. This catches menus that never call the hook, which is why
     both checks exist - check 2 alone was blind to 8 of the 12 popovers this rule was written
     for, including a scrollable, height-capped one (`ToolBreakdownPopover`).

  Neither check can tell whether a mount site actually clips, which is why they are the
  tripwire and the UI specs are the guard.
- **Test (first-open width, behavior):** `tests/ui/popover-first-open-alignment.spec.ts` opens
  the Settings > Agent comboboxes on a fresh page at 1920x1080 and asserts the menu's left edge
  and width match the field on the FIRST open (then again after a close). Each test owns its
  page on purpose: a page where an earlier test already opened the same combobox carries the
  surviving width state and passes against the broken code. It read 823px red before the fix.
- **Test (first-open width, tripwire):** the same unit file fails any file that calls
  `usePopoverPosition` AND reads `getBoundingClientRect().width` itself, unless the line carries
  `popover-width-ok: <reason>`, and pins that the hook's `popover.style.width` write precedes
  both `offset*` reads. The scan is what closes the read-trigger gap for a brand-new combobox
  file, which does not pre-load this rule; the unit tier has no DOM, so it cannot render the hook.
- **Review:** `/code-review` flags a new in-flow menu on renderer changes, and a consumer that
  measures its trigger width in its own effect instead of passing `matchTriggerWidth`.

## Scope

Choice-presenting popovers under `src/renderer/`. Does not govern tooltips (small, no scroll,
clipping is cosmetic), context menus (already `position: fixed` at the cursor), or floating
toolbars that are deliberately positioned inside their own pane.
