# Session Lifecycle

This document describes the full session state machine in Kangentic, covering how Claude Code CLI sessions are spawned, queued, suspended, resumed, and recovered.

## State Machine

There are two separate state representations:

- **`SessionStatus`** -- in-memory runtime state of a `ManagedSession` inside `SessionManager`. Values: `running`, `queued`, `exited`, `suspended`.
- **`SessionRecordStatus`** -- persisted in the SQLite database as a `SessionRecord`. Values: `running`, `queued`, `suspended`, `exited`, `orphaned`.

The in-memory `SessionStatus` does not include `orphaned` (that is a DB-only concept discovered on next launch). Both types include `queued` - the DB record is created with `status: 'queued'` at spawn time and promoted to `running` when a concurrency slot opens.

```
                  +----------+
                  |  queued  |
                  +----+-----+
                       |
              slot opens (SessionQueue promotes)
                       |
                       v
+------------+    +----------+    +-----------+
| suspended  |<---| running  |--->|  exited   |
+-----+------+    +----+-----+    +-----------+
      |                |                ^
      |                | app crashes    | killed while queued
      |                v                |
      |           +----------+    +-----+----+
      +---------->| orphaned |<---|  queued   |
   (recovery)    +----------+  (app crashes)
```

### States

| State | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `queued` | Both | Waiting for a concurrency slot to open |
| `running` | Both | PTY is live, Claude Code CLI process is active |
| `suspended` | Both | PTY killed, but session ID and files preserved for resume |
| `exited` | Both | Process exited naturally or was killed; terminal state |
| `orphaned` | DB only | App crashed while session was running; discovered on next launch |

### Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|
| `queued` | `running` | Concurrency slot opens, `SessionQueue` promotes |
| `queued` | `exited` | Session killed while still queued |
| `running` | `suspended` | Task moved to Done or `auto_spawn=false` column |
| `running` | `suspended` | A column or Board Profile edit flips `auto_spawn` to false while the task is already sitting there, with no move at all (`reconcileAutoSpawnChange`, `suspended_by='system'`) |
| `running` | `exited` | Task moved to To Do (full cleanup via `cleanupTaskResources`) |
| `running` | `exited` | Process exits naturally or is killed. Every `-> exited` transition also destroys any offscreen browser lanes that session opened (`destroyLanesForSession`), which is the guarantee that lanes cannot outlive their agent - see [Embedded Browser](embedded-browser.md) decision 29 |
| `running` | `exited` | The agent CLI exited on its own while its shell PTY survived, so no PTY exit ever fired. The bg-shell watcher's [agent-absence sweep](#a-session-whose-agent-exited-under-a-surviving-shell) confirms it over two probes and retires the session |
| `running` | `orphaned` | App crashes, leftover `running` DB record found on next launch |
| `queued` | `orphaned` | App crashes, leftover `queued` DB record found on next launch |
| `suspended` | `running` | Task moved to active column, resumed via `--resume` |
| `suspended` | `exited` | Replaced by a new session on resume (`retireRecord`) |
| `orphaned` | `running` | Session recovery on project open |
| `orphaned` | `exited` | Recovery dedup, or failed recovery (`retireRecord`) |
| `exited` | `exited` | A resume replaces a record that had already ended on its own (`retireRecord`'s fallback CAS). Confirms the row is out of the way without restamping `exited_at`, so the CLI's real end time survives a later restart; only the `suspended` and `orphaned` rows above get a fresh stamp |
| `orphaned` | `suspended` | Pause-on-restart setting upgrades a crashed session (`markRecordSuspended`) |
| `exited` | `running` | OS-killed (abnormal `exit_code`) session resumed by recovery on project open (`getInterruptedExited`) |
| `exited` | `suspended` | Interrupted-exited record CAS-upgraded by recovery (non-target / non-auto-spawn / auto-resume-off), or a PTY exit during app shutdown (onExit hardening) |
| `running` | `suspended` | App shutdown race: PTY exits while `isShuttingDown()` (onExit hardening keeps it resumable) |

## Spawn Flow

### Spawn entry points

Every way a task agent can be spawned routes through one of TWO chokepoints, and both run the
shared spawn preamble `runSpawnPreamble` (`src/main/transition-engine/spawn-preamble.ts`): lock
the Advanced overrides (`lockAdvancedOverridesOnFirstSpawn`) - on a first-ever spawn, or whenever
the task is leaving a todo-role settings lane - then resolve the target agent
(`resolveTargetAgent`), in that order. Permission mode is resolved by the same
module's `resolveEffectivePermissionMode` (a lane forcing `plan` always wins, else task -> lane
-> global). Enforced by `.claude/rules/spawn-entry-point-parity.md` +
`tests/unit/spawn-entry-point-parity.test.ts`.

| Entry point | Trigger | Route |
|---|---|---|
| Task move (Phase 3 deferred spawn) | drag into an auto_spawn column | `spawnAgent` (`src/main/ipc/helpers/agent-spawn.ts`), `settingsSourceLane` = source lane |
| Create into a spawn column | New Task dialog / `TASK_CREATE` | `spawnAgent`, `fromSwimlaneId: '*'` |
| Backlog promote | promote from Backlog panel | `spawnAgent`, `fromSwimlaneId: '*'` |
| MCP create (`kangentic_create_task`) | `autoSpawnForTask` | `spawnAgent` |
| Column auto-spawn switched on | a column edit or a Board Profile edit, from either the Board Manager or the MCP `update_column` / profile tools, via `reconcileAutoSpawnChange` | `autoSpawnForTask` -> `spawnAgent` (sequential, skips user-paused, active project only) |
| Unarchive (single + bulk) | Completed Tasks restore / `TASK_UNARCHIVE` | `spawnAgent`, `skipPromptTemplate` + `suppressAutoCommand` (recovery move) |
| Phone Start (`start-session` verb) | "Start again" from the phone's ended state, via `startTaskSession` (`handlers/session-start.ts`) | `autoSpawnForTask` -> `spawnAgent`, `explicitStart` (lifts the column's `auto_spawn` default and a user pause, as the desktop Resume button does; the role gate stays) |
| Startup crash recovery | project open, `resumeSuspendedSessions` | `prepareAgentSpawn` (`session-startup/prepare-spawn.ts`) |
| Startup reconcile | project open, `autoSpawnTasks` | `prepareAgentSpawn` |

In-place restarts of an existing session (`SESSION_RESUME`, `restartSessionForSettingsChange`)
call the engine directly; they are not first-spawn entry points. Transient Command Terminal
sessions bypass all of this (not task agents).

### Engine spawn (board-driven path)

1. `spawnAgent` runs the spawn preamble, executes the transition's actions, then falls back to
   `resumeSuspendedSession` if no action created a session.
2. `TransitionEngine.executeSpawnAgent()`:
   - Detect the agent CLI via the resolved adapter
   - Resolve permission mode via `resolveEffectivePermissionMode` (lane `plan` always wins,
     else task pin -> lane -> global)
   - Determine CWD (worktree path or project path)
   - Apply agent-specific pre-spawn global-config state via `adapter.ensureTrust(cwd)`. The
     call is generic (no agent-name branching); each adapter writes its own store: Claude
     `~/.claude.json`, Codex `~/.codex/config.toml` `[projects]`, Gemini and Qwen
     `trustedFolders.json`. Adapters with no such state implement it as a no-op. Trust
     pre-population for the worktree path is the main job, but not the only one: Claude also
     writes `diffSidebarOpen: false` here to keep its fullscreen diff panel closed (see
     [Global Config Writes](agent-integration.md#global-config-writes-claudejson)). Every path
     that builds an agent command calls this first, including the Command Terminal.
   - Check for previous suspended session (can resume?)
   - If resuming: reconcile the stored `agent_session_id` against the record's own `status.json` (see [Resume](#resume)), then use it with `--resume`, no prompt
   - If fresh: generate new UUID for `agent_session_id`, use `--session-id`, include prompt
   - Create session directory at `.kangentic/sessions/<agentSessionId>/`
   - Build agent CLI command via `CommandBuilder`
   - Call `SessionManager.spawn()`
3. `SessionManager.spawn()`:
   - Check concurrency limit; queue if full (returns `queued` placeholder)
   - If under limit, call `doSpawn()`:
     - Drain EVERY existing registry row for the task, not just the first match (`SessionRegistry.listByTaskId`): kill each PTY, detach its files while preserving them on disk, clear its per-session caches, then carry scrollback and geometry over from the most recently started row that is not the id being reused (a queued placeholder being promoted reuses its own id and has no scrollback). This is what keeps the in-memory registry at one row per task; a spawn that evicted only the first match left a second stale row listed ahead of the live PTY.
     - Resolve shell and arguments (platform-specific)
     - Spawn PTY via `node-pty`
     - Start status file watcher (100ms debounce)
     - Start events file watcher (50ms debounce)
     - Set up output handler (16ms batched flush, 512KB scrollback)
     - After 100ms delay, write CLI command to PTY stdin (agent spawns prefixed with the shell's own clear via `buildSpawnClearPrelude`; transient Command Terminals exempt)

## Queue

- Configurable max concurrent sessions (`config.agent.maxConcurrentSessions`, config default: 8). The `SessionQueue` constructor initializes with a hardcoded limit of 5; the actual config value is applied via `setMaxConcurrent()` when config loads at startup.
- When the limit is reached, the session receives a `queued` status placeholder.
- When a running session exits or is suspended, `notifySlotFreed()` promotes the next queued entry.
- Reentrancy-safe: a `_processing` flag prevents concurrent promotion, and a `_dirty` flag ensures re-iteration if the queue changed during a spawn await.

## Suspend and Cleanup

Session teardown varies by target column:

- **To Do** (role=`todo`), via `TASK_MOVE` - full cleanup via `cleanupTaskResources()`: kills the PTY (via `SessionManager.remove()`), deletes session files from disk, deletes all session DB records for the task, and then removes the worktree and (when `git.autoCleanup` is on) force-deletes the branch. Destructive, which is why the drop is gated behind a pending-changes confirmation. Moving back to an active column spawns a fresh session.
- **To Do** (role=`todo`), via `TASK_UNARCHIVE` / `TASK_BULK_UNARCHIVE` (restore from Done) - the SESSION-only half, `cleanupTaskSession()`. The worktree and branch are left alone. Without this the task keeps the session Done deliberately suspended, and since `listSessions()` has no status filter the restored card renders "Paused" for the rest of the app session. It is not the full `cleanupTaskResources()` on purpose: `deleteTaskWorktree` nulls `worktree_path` only when the Done-time removal SUCCEEDED, so a task whose worktree was pinned at Done time (routine on Windows) still carries both fields, and the full helper would re-attempt the removal and force-delete the branch holding its committed work with no confirmation on this route.
- **Done** (role=`done`) - suspends session (preserves for resume via `SessionManager.suspend()`), archives task, and deletes the worktree to reclaim disk while preserving `branch_name` and the session records. The DB record is marked `suspended` so the session can be resumed if the task is later unarchived into an auto-spawn column. That unarchive is the ONLY route back: resuming in place is refused for a Done or archived task (see [Where resume is refused](#where-resume-is-refused)), since it would recreate the worktree this move deleted.
- **Any column with `auto_spawn=false`** - suspends session (same as Done, but without archiving). A restore into such a column keeps the suspended session and its Resume affordance; only a `role=todo` target resets it.

### Reaping what the session left running

On the TERMINAL transitions above (move to To Do or Backlog, move to Done, and task delete), the teardown also kills processes the session left running inside the worktree. An agent that backgrounds a dev server leaves it running when the session ends; on Windows it then holds the worktree directory as its current directory and blocks the removal.

The mechanism is `captureSessionLeftovers()` before the kill or suspend, then `reapSessionLeftovers()` after it and before any worktree delete (both in `src/main/ipc/helpers/task-cleanup.ts`). The capture must come first: the bg-shell watcher stops publishing once the session ends, and on POSIX the children are reparented to init at once, so there is no tree to walk afterwards.

The capture reads a snapshot the watcher already computed for its own counting, so it costs nothing on the drag-to-Done path. Nothing here enumerates processes; a cold `powershell` spawn measures ~670ms even for a pid-only projection. See [worktree-strategy.md](worktree-strategy.md) for the removal-time backstop and why Windows needs the parent-chain route at all.

`auto_spawn=false` columns and a user-pressed Stop are deliberately NOT terminal: the task is parked rather than finished, so its dev server stays up for manual testing.

### What is preserved on suspend (Done / auto_spawn=false)

- `agent_session_id` (for `--resume` on next spawn)
- Worktree directory and branch
- Session files on disk (`status.json`, `events.jsonl`, `settings.json`)
- Scrollback buffer in memory

### What is destroyed on To Do cleanup

- PTY process (force-killed, after the exit-sequence grace when the session is young; see below)
- Session files on disk (deleted)
- All session DB records for the task (deleted)
- In-memory caches (usage, activity, events) for the session

Before the registry row is deleted, `SessionManager.remove()` emits `session-removed` (broadcast
as `SESSION_REMOVED`) with the row's last snapshot. The renderer's `removeSession` drops the row,
the task index entry, and every per-session map entry keyed on the id (`withoutSessions` in
`session-index.ts`). Two failures shaped this:

- With no push at all, a status push landing mid-teardown (a `syncSessions()` call in the grace
  window, say) resurrected the row via `withSessionUpserted` after the renderer's SESSION_EXIT
  handler had already ignored the intentional exit, leaving a ghost `running` card and panel tab
  for an agent that no longer existed anywhere in main (#80).
- Announcing the removal as a forced-`exited` `session-changed` fixed that and caused #661: the
  status channel's only renderer handler is an upsert, so for a task moved to To Do (whose rows
  `moveTask` evicts optimistically the instant the move starts) the removal itself re-inserted an
  `exited` row for a PTY, worktree, and session directory that no longer existed, and its surviving
  `sessionUsage` entry filled a context bar under a black terminal. A removal and a status change
  cannot share one channel.

The renderer also refuses to paint anything session-shaped for a task in a `todo`-role lane, whatever
row the store holds (`laneHoldsSession` and the lane-aware `taskDetailSurfaceFor` in
`task-progress.ts`; `useTaskSessionState` resolves such a task's session to null), and both spawn
chokepoints refuse the To Do and Done roles regardless of `auto_spawn`, so that classification is
true rather than assumed.

The same contract covers a bare `kill()`: the renderer's `SESSION_EXIT` handler ignores an
intentional exit, so every kill site follows up with the push that says what happened. `remove()`
announces `session-removed`, `suspend()` announces `suspended`, and a caller that keeps the row after
`kill()` + `awaitExit()` (the `cleanup_worktree` transition action) calls
`SessionManager.announceSessionEnded()`, which re-emits the row on `session-changed` with its resolved
status. `tests/unit/session-kill-followup.test.ts` scans every kill site for one of those. The full
contract is `.claude/rules/session-replica-contract.md`; the property that ties it together is
`tests/unit/session-store-replica-convergence.test.ts`, which drives the real store over random
interleavings of pushes, optimistic evictions, and stale syncs and asserts it ends equal to main's
registry. Also pinned by `tests/unit/session-manager-remove-emit.test.ts`,
`tests/unit/session-store-remove-session.test.ts`, `tests/ui/todo-reset-no-ghost-session.spec.ts`,
and `tests/ui/todo-stale-exited-row-opens-edit.spec.ts`.

### SessionManager.kill() and the young-session grace

`kill()` is synchronous and never resumable. It marks the session `intentionalExit`, nulls
`session.pty` at once (so `write()` / `resize()` no-op and a respawn cannot find the old PTY), and
then either force-kills immediately or, for a YOUNG session, writes the adapter's exit sequence and
parks the PTY on `DeferredKillRegistry` (`src/main/pty/lifecycle/deferred-kill.ts`), whose timer
force-kills it `KILL_GRACE_MS` (1500 ms) later.

Young means the agent may still be inside Claude Code's fullscreen boot-canary window: Claude writes
`fullscreenBootPending[pid]` to `~/.claude.json` at REPL mount and withdraws it 10 s after the first
frame or on a graceful exit, and a dead pid found at the next launch is a strike (one: classic
renderer for that launch; two: sticky until `/tui fullscreen`). A bare `pty.kill()` gives Claude
about 100 ms and the locked withdrawal needs 82 to 97 ms idle, so the grace is what lets it land.
The predicate (`isYoungSession`): alt-screen entered under `YOUNG_AFTER_ALT_SCREEN_MS` (12 s) ago,
or no alt screen yet and spawned under `YOUNG_SINCE_SPAWN_MS` (60 s) ago. The first alt-screen entry
is stamped on the row as `altScreenEnteredAt` by the buffer manager's `onAltScreenEnter`.

The deferred PTY lives OUTSIDE the registry row on purpose: `remove()` may delete the row in the
same tick, and the respawn sibling drain hard-kills any row it finds for the task. The registry
attaches no PTY listener; the spawn flow's `onExit` stays attached (it still emits `'exit'` after
the row is gone) and the manager's own `'exit'` event cancels the timer on a natural exit.
`kill(id, { immediate: true })` skips the grace for the agent-absence sweep, whose agent is already
gone.

A caller that touches the cwd or process tree after a kill therefore waits for the PROCESS: `kill`,
capture `awaitExit` (the row must still exist), then `remove`, then await before any `rmSync`,
`removeWorktree`, or `reapSessionLeftovers`. `cleanupTaskSession`, `executeCleanupWorktree`, project
delete, project relocate, the MCP task delete, and `SESSION_KILL_TRANSIENT` all do. The rule and its
scan: `.claude/rules/pty-teardown-grace.md`.

### SessionManager.suspend() flow

1. Remove the adapter's hooks from the project settings file (idempotent with `onExit`)
2. Close file watchers and detach telemetry readers, preserving the files for resume
3. Flush the transcript to the DB
4. Emit a synthetic `session_end` event (the agent's own hook will not fire on a kill)
5. Clear subagent depth tracking
6. Mark status as `suspended`
7. **Emit `session-changed`** - before the shutdown below, not after
8. Release backpressure so the agent's exit-sequence output is not held back
9. `gracefulPtyShutdown`: send the exit sequence, wait up to 1500ms for a natural exit, then
   force-kill and wait up to 1500ms more for kill propagation
10. Last-resort scrollback scan for an agent session id not yet captured
11. **Emit `session-changed` again** - now carrying the post-shutdown session
12. Notify the queue (slot freed)

Steps 7 and 11 are a deliberate DOUBLE emit, and both are load-bearing:

- Step 7 exists because the bottom panel's tab set is `status === 'running'`
  (`derivePanelSessions`). Emitting only at the end left a tab for a session the user had already
  watched leave the board, for the whole of step 9. A user-initiated Pause never showed that,
  because the renderer store writes the suspended status optimistically; a main-driven suspend
  (move to Done, idle timeout, settings restart) had no such write and wore the full delay.
- Step 11 carries state that only exists after the shutdown, including an agent session id
  recovered by step 10.

The gap between them is what sets `FINALIZE_DEBOUNCE_MS` (3500) in
`src/main/retrieval/retrieval-service.ts`: finalize indexing is debounced per session, and the
two reports can be up to 3000ms apart on a force-kill, so a shorter window would fail to coalesce
them on exactly the slow path where the later read matters most.

## Resume

### Where resume is refused

`SESSION_RESUME` (the task detail's Pause/Resume toggle) restarts a suspended session **in
place**, in the task's current column. It is refused for three states, resolved by one shared
predicate (`src/shared/session-resume-eligibility.ts`) that the main-process handler, the task
detail, and the phone's `startTaskSession` (`handlers/session-start.ts`, the `start-session` verb)
all read, and whose role set startup recovery shares:

| State | Why |
|---|---|
| Lane role `todo` | A To Do card has not started; its detail opens straight into the edit form |
| Lane role `done` | The task is complete. The route back is to move it OUT of Done |
| `archived_at` set | Same, for a task archived without a live Done-role lane |

Resuming a completed task in place would recreate the worktree the move to Done had just deleted
and leave the task archived AND running at once, with no board card to show for it. The supported
route is the recovery move below, which unarchives first and then spawns through the normal
chokepoint, so the refusal never applies to it. The main-process guard is the contract; the task
detail hides the control so it is never offered. Pausing a session that is genuinely live is NOT
refused in any of those states, so a stray agent can still be stopped from the window showing it.

### A resume with no conversation behind it is downgraded to fresh

Kangentic pre-specifies `--session-id` for Claude and persists it on the session record AT SPAWN
TIME, before the agent has done anything, while the agent CLI writes its transcript on the first
turn. A session that ends before that turn therefore leaves a resumable-looking record pointing at
a conversation that does not exist.

That is reachable in seconds of ordinary use: the recovery move out of Done spawns command-free,
so the agent comes up idle with nothing to do, and moving the task back to Done before typing
suspends it with its id intact. Every later entry into an auto-spawn column then issued
`--resume <id>`, the CLI answered "No conversation found with session ID", and the user was left on
a bare shell with the record still reading `running` (the shell PTY outlives the CLI).

`isResumeConversationAbsent` (`src/main/transition-engine/resume-conversation-guard.ts`) now
downgrades that spawn to fresh at both chokepoints (`executeSpawnAgent` and `prepareAgentSpawn`).
It fires only on positive evidence of an empty conversation. Two things must hold together:

- the transcript path was reported by the AGENT itself, never derived by Kangentic;
- the same report independently shows the conversation never took a turn;

and then the file that report names must be absent.

The evidence comes from either of two agent-written files in Kangentic's own session directory,
which differ in how each answers the turn question:

| Source | Transcript path | "Never took a turn" means |
|---|---|---|
| `status.json` (preferred) | the status line's `transcript_path` | no tokens and no cost |
| `events.jsonl` (fallback) | `transcript_path` inside the SessionStart hook payload | no event beyond `session_start` / `session_end` |

The fallback exists because the status line only runs once the TUI is up, so a CLI killed in its
first second leaves none. The SessionStart hook fires far earlier. A missing status file therefore
does NOT end the check: it falls through to the hook, and only a record that yields neither report
is skipped.

The guard returns false - resuming exactly as before - when the adapter has no status pipeline,
when the project path is unknown, or when no record yields a usable report at all. Absence of
evidence is never evidence, so a conversation that had turns is never discarded. Mocked CLIs land
on that path structurally, which is what kept the E2E resume specs passing. This is deliberately
narrower than the `canResumeSession` transcript-presence guard reverted in #255 (see
docs/adapter-session-history.md), whose false misses silently lost real conversations.

The board chokepoint walks every record sharing the conversation's `agent_session_id`, newest
first, because a failed resume writes no report of its own and an already-poisoned task would
otherwise stay broken forever. Startup recovery passes only the record it is recovering: it holds
no repository handle to walk the lineage, and a record recovered there ran until the crash, so it
normally has its own status report.

### A session whose agent exited under a surviving shell

Kangentic spawns a SHELL and writes the agent CLI command to its stdin, so the agent CLI is a
CHILD of the PTY root, never the root itself (`getSessionRootPid` returns `session.pty.pid`). When
the CLI exits on its own - a user typing `/exit`, a CLI crash, a launch that fails - the shell
survives, the PTY never fires `onExit`, and nothing marks the session finished. The record stays
`running` with `suspended_at` and `exited_at` NULL, the status bar counts a phantom agent, the card
reads active, and the bottom panel keeps a tab (its tab set is `status === 'running'`,
`derivePanelSessions`).

`isResumeConversationAbsent` (above) removed one trigger. The general case is closed by an
**agent-absence sweep**, a third tier of the bg-shell watcher
(`src/main/activity-engine/background-shell/watcher.ts`). The watcher is already registered for
every spawned session, already holds each session's root PID, and already takes one shared process
snapshot per cycle, so the sweep adds no new subsystem.

**No descendant process means no agent.** That is agent-agnostic, so it needs no adapter
capability and no agent-name branching. Two things make it correct rather than merely plausible:

- **The predicate is any-descendant, not shell-like.** `hasNoNonConsoleDescendants`
  (`process-tree.ts`) deliberately does NOT reuse `filterTopmostShellLikeDescendants`, which exists
  to HIDE the `cmd.exe` shim an agent CLI is often launched through - the opposite of what this
  question needs. Measured live: a real session tree is `pwsh -> cmd.exe -> node`, and the
  shell-like filter would treat that `cmd.exe` as a helper.
- **Console hosts are filtered as defense in depth.** Measured across three live instances, all
  nine ConPTY session shells had their `conhost.exe` parented to the ELECTRON caller (a sibling,
  not a descendant), so a bare shell's descendant set really was empty and a plain emptiness check
  would have sufficed. The filter is kept because console-host parenting is an unspecified Windows
  detail that varies by console host and launch path, and the failure is asymmetric: one stray
  console host would silently disable the sweep for that session forever, while filtering costs
  ~0.3us per cycle for a whole fleet.
- **A false positive is worse than the phantom**, so five guards must all hold: the PTY root itself
  alive (otherwise this is ordinary root death); a HEALTHY probe, reusing the watcher's existing
  discriminator that the snapshot must contain the verified-alive root (an empty or partial
  snapshot means the probe failed, not that nothing is running); two consecutive confirmations;
  past a 30s spawn grace; and the session being a `SessionManager`-approved candidate.

`SessionManager.isAgentAbsenceCandidate` owns every session-shaped arm, so the watcher needs no
session knowledge. It requires a `running`, non-transient session with a live PTY, an agent adapter,
a non-WSL shell, and an elapsed spawn grace. The **transient exclusion is load-bearing**: a Command Terminal is a
bare shell BY DESIGN and is registered with the watcher like any task agent, so without it the sweep
would retire every Command Terminal the moment it opened. A slow-STARTING agent is not excluded by
the grace and does not need to be - its process exists, it just has not drawn yet, which is exactly
why the process tree is a safer signal than a first-output timeout.

The **WSL exclusion covers a different failure than the others**: there the tree signal is
UNREADABLE, not empty. A WSL session's PTY root is `wsl.exe`, and the agent is not a Win32
descendant of it either way - a distro-native CLI is a Linux process in another PID namespace, and
the interop path Kangentic actually uses ([cross-platform.md](cross-platform.md#wsl-runs-the-windows-binary-interop))
launches the Windows binary through WSL's binfmt host rather than under this `wsl.exe`. Since the
Windows probe enumerates `Win32_Process`, a perfectly HEALTHY WSL agent presents an empty descendant
set and passes every other arm, so the sweep would force-kill live work. Refusing to judge it fails
safe to the pre-existing phantom instead. Note this arm is a DENYLIST and closes only the known
case; an allowlist (require that the tree showed a non-console descendant at least once before
absence can be concluded) would close the whole class of structurally invisible subtrees.

**Cadence.** The sweep runs on its own 60s clock (`AGENT_ABSENCE_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`), decoupled from
the watcher's 2s/4s/6s poll backoff, and evaluates for free on any cycle that already enumerated for
bg-shell work. `listAllProcesses` is a ~200ms PowerShell CIM query on Windows and the watcher
deliberately skips it on idle cycles, so a per-session-per-cycle check would defeat that
optimization exactly when the machine is saturated. A sweep-only cycle neither increments nor resets
the bg-shell backoff counter. The counter counts consecutive OBSERVATIONS, not poll cycles: a
skipped cycle is neutral, because resetting on skips would mean the count could never reach two.

**What it does.** `SessionManager.retireAgentlessSession` re-checks the guard (the watcher decides
asynchronously) and routes through `kill()`, so the entire existing exit path runs: record marked
exited, queue slot freed, hooks stripped, transcript flushed, and `intentionalExit` suppressing the
renderer's false "Session crashed" toast. Once the tab is gone the leftover shell is unreachable,
so leaving it alive would only leak a process.

**It first emits `agent-absent`, so a failure the CLI named is not lost with it.** The kill's
`intentionalExit` also silences the exit listener's startup-failure read, and a CLI that ended at
boot with its own account of why (Claude's "No conversation found with session ID" on a `--resume`
whose transcript was cleaned up or whose project folder moved) reached the user as a card that
went quiet: exit code 0, no toast, a dead row (#682 follow-up). The retirement therefore announces
the absence before the kill, while the ring still holds the CLI's last words; `handlers/sessions.ts`
asks the session's adapter to read them (`AgentAdapter.describeStartupFailure`, implemented by
Claude) and raises `notifySpawnBlocked`'s "Agent did not start" notice when they name a failure. The
rare direct PTY exit (the CLI was the root, or its shell ended with it) takes the same read from the
exit listener when the exit is not intentional. A notice after the fact, deliberately not a
pre-spawn guard: see the `isResumeConversationAbsent` section above for why a computed-path
downgrade was reverted in #255.

**It must also emit `session-changed`, and that emit is load-bearing.** Measured in a live preview:
with `kill()` alone, main and the DB were both correct (`exited`, code 0) while the board kept
counting the agent and the bottom panel kept its tab - the exact two symptoms the sweep exists to
remove. The renderer's `SESSION_EXIT` handler deliberately returns early on an INTENTIONAL exit
(`App.tsx`), because it cannot tell a suspend from a hard end without racing the suspended status
push, so it never runs its own `updateSessionStatus`; and both `derivePanelSessions` and the agent
count read the renderer store, not the DB. `session-changed` (broadcast as `SESSION_STATUS`) carries
a resolved status and has no such ambiguity, so the retirement announces itself there. Pinned by
`tests/unit/session-manager-agent-absence.test.ts`.

The reported exit code is forced to **0** via `ManagedSession.overrideExitCode`, which deliberately
MASKS the OS code. A force-kill reports abnormally on every platform, and `getInterruptedExited`
resumes exactly those on the next launch - so the real code would resurrect the very conversation
the user `/exit`-ed, contradicting that query's "clean exit 0 is excluded". This coupling is pinned
by `tests/unit/session-interrupted-exited-sql.test.ts`, which runs the real query over both designs.

The sweep inherits the watcher's kill switches (`disableBgShellWatcher`,
`KANGENTIC_BG_SHELL_WATCHER=0`, a missing `getSessionRootPid`); with the watcher off there is no
phantom detection, which is accepted since it is the same subsystem. Covered by the `agent-absence
sweep` block in `tests/unit/bg-shell-watcher.test.ts` and by
`tests/unit/session-manager-agent-absence.test.ts`.

### A restore reports progress instead of showing a Resume button

Restoring from Done is slow (the worktree is recreated from the preserved branch, then the CLI
boots) and the task's suspended record survives that whole window, so the UI used to advertise a
manual "Resume session" button while the engine was already restoring the conversation. Two things
now prevent that:

- `TASK_UNARCHIVE` / `TASK_BULK_UNARCHIVE` thread `onProgress` into their git helpers exactly as
  `task-move` does, and emit `resuming` immediately so the card is never silent while the lane is
  resolved and the git op queues.
- `getTaskProgress` lets an in-flight spawn label outrank a `suspended` session (only `suspended`;
  a running or queued session owns its own display). An emitted label means main is spawning right
  now, which is newer than a record suspended earlier.

The task therefore shows the `preparing` launch overlay from about 100ms after the drop, through
"Creating worktree..." and "Starting agent...", until the terminal takes over.

The same mechanism generalizes to a **same-column respawn**: a live session forced to suspend and
restart in place, not because the task moved to Done and back but because the destination column
needs new CLI flags on a resumed process. `suspendLiveSessionForRespawn`
(`src/main/ipc/handlers/task-move.ts`) is the shared helper behind all four triggers - a model
change, a cross-agent handoff, an effort delta with no live `/effort` swap, and a session-track
switch (isolated-column entry/exit, or `always_spawn_new`) - and it emits its phase label
(`switching-model` / `switching-agent` / `applying-settings` / `new-session`) as its first
statement, before the record is even marked suspended. Without this, the suspend that begins the
respawn left the card reading "Paused" and the detail offering a manual "Resume session" for the
whole unlocked worktree/branch-checkout window between the suspend and the eventual
`starting-agent` label.

The in-place restart, `restartSessionForSettingsChange` (`src/main/ipc/handlers/session-reconcile.ts`),
follows the same contract with a required `phase`: the ContextBar model pick and a Board Profile
propagation emit `switching-model` (or `applying-settings` for an effort-only restart), and the
auto_command escalation emits `resending-command` ("Re-sending command..."). It emits before its
suspend and clears the label in a `finally` once the resume has returned or failed, the ordering
task-move's Phase 3 uses. The emit is what lets the mobile bridge tell this respawn from a park
(see [Mobile Bridge](mobile-bridge.md)); until #682 this path emitted nothing, and the phone showed
"Session ended" for the swap.

That main-side emit alone is not sufficient: `SessionManager.suspend()` pushes the session's
`suspended` row to the renderer almost immediately, well before its own graceful-shutdown wait
completes, and the renderer's `upsertSession` (`src/renderer/stores/session-store.ts`) used to
clear any in-flight spawn-progress label on every arriving row - including that one - wiping the
label within milliseconds of it being set. `upsertSession` now skips the clear specifically when
the arriving row's status is `suspended`, since that row is the respawn's own suspend landing, not
a genuine park. `clearSpawnProgress` remains the only way a label actually retires, but only two
park paths in `task-move.ts` call it explicitly (move to Done, move into an `auto_spawn=false`
column). Five other genuine parks - `SESSION_SUSPEND` (a manual pause), the idle-timeout suspend,
the `kill_session` action, project-relocate, and auto-spawn-reconcile - suspend through
`applySuspendDbWrites` or `executeKillSession` and never clear a label explicitly; this is a
known gap, not fixed here, and a label still in flight when one of those fires survives until the
120s TTL sweeps it (see the carve-out's own comment in `session-store.ts` for the full list).

When a suspended task moves to an active column:

- Command: `claude --settings <path> --resume <agentSessionId>` (no prompt)
- The resumed id tracks mid-session forks. Running `/clear` inside a Claude session forks the
  conversation to a brand-new session id; the statusline re-reports it and the change-sensitive
  status-file capture (`SessionTelemetry.processStatusUpdate` -> `recoverStaleSessionId`)
  rewrites `sessions.agent_session_id` live. At resume time,
  `reconcileResumeAgentSessionId` (`src/main/transition-engine/resume-id-reconcile.ts`)
  additionally checks the retiring record's own `status.json` and swaps the resumed id if a fork
  landed in the final seconds before suspend (the status watcher detaches before the CLI exits).
  Details and the empirical grounding: docs/adapter-session-history.md, "Mid-session fork
  reconcile".
- New PTY spawned with scrollback carried over from the most recently started previous row for the task (see Spawn Flow above)
- New session DB record inserted, old record marked `exited`
- The destination column's settings are re-applied as CLI flags on the resume
  command: `--permission-mode` (lane override, else global default), `--model`,
  and `--effort`. A column move that changes the effective permission mode
  forces this suspend + respawn cycle, because no adapter can switch
  permission mode on a live session.
- A plan-exit auto-move (Planning -> Executing), triggered when the user
  approves the plan (the `ExitPlanMode` tool completes, not when the agent
  merely invokes it), passes a continuation prompt
  ("Proceed with implementing the approved plan.") delivered as the resumed
  session's first message when the destination column has no `auto_command`;
  the `auto_command` wins when present.
- The resume prompt is also how **auto_command escalation** lands. When a live
  session's keystroke injection cannot be confirmed in the agent's transcript,
  `restartSessionForSettingsChange` suspends and resumes with the command as the
  prompt argument, which is guaranteed by the spawn rather than by TUI timing.
  That restart is gated on the turn-completion predicate (activity idle AND a
  quiet PTY) so it can never kill live work, is attempted at most once, and
  carries only the user's `auto_command` - never an adapter-emitted settings
  write, which would arrive as literal message text. While the gate waits, the
  scheduler re-polls the verifier against the burst's original first-Enter
  watermark, and a late confirmation cancels the restart: a command that went
  in but confirmed late (a late transcript flush, or a submission the CLI
  queued behind a running turn) must not be run a second time, which is what
  happened on every observed Tests-to-Ship-It move before #682. Unlike the
  ordinary settings-change restart it does NOT assert idle-authoritative
  afterwards, because a resume with a prompt starts a real turn. See
  [Command Injection](command-injection.md) for the full delivery ladder.
- The **first move OUT of Done** (the recovery / restore move, whatever the
  destination column) resumes the session WITHOUT delivering the destination
  column's message. Restoring a Done task is usually to inspect the
  session or ask a question, so the message (e.g. `/merge-pull-request`)
  sits idle until the next move. This is unconditional and matches crash
  recovery, which also resumes command-free. Every Done-out path goes through
  `spawnAgent`'s `suppressAutoCommand`: the unarchive handlers
  (`TASK_UNARCHIVE` / `TASK_BULK_UNARCHIVE`) set it on their `spawnAgent`
  calls, and a non-archived Done-out move (MCP `move_task`, legacy rows) gets
  it from `handleTaskMove` when `fromLane.role === 'done'`. Model / effort /
  permission-mode settings still apply on the recovery move. The next move
  delivers per column config as usual.

  **Only rows that need the agent are suppressed.** The destination's On enter
  group still runs, so a script, a webhook or a notification fires as it
  normally would; a recovery move is not a reason to stop telling a webhook the
  task moved. The flag reaches the runner as `suppressAgentMessages` and each
  suppressed row is recorded `skipped` with the reason, rather than being
  allowed to run against a `deliverToAgent` that silently does nothing and then
  report a success for a message nobody received. See
  [Transition Engine](transition-engine.md#command-injection).

## Crash Recovery (Session Recovery)

On project open (`src/main/transition-engine/session-startup/`):

1. **Prune orphaned worktrees** -- delete tasks whose worktree directories were removed externally
2. **Mark crash recovery** -- leftover `running` DB records become `orphaned` (skip records with live PTYs to handle re-entrant calls)
3. **Collect candidates** -- all `suspended` + `orphaned` agent records, plus OS-killed **interrupted-exited** records (any `session_type` except `run_script`). An interrupted-exited record is `status='exited'` with an *abnormal* code (`exit_code != 0`, cross-platform: Windows `1073807364`, Unix `137`/`143`/`130`), a captured `agent_session_id`, that is the latest record for its `(task, session_type, isolation)` group (`getInterruptedExited`). This catches a hard shutdown (OS restart, power loss, SIGKILL) where the PTY died and the onExit handler recorded `exited` before the clean-quit path could mark it `suspended`. Clean exit 0 is excluded so a deliberate `/exit` is never resurrected on startup.

   Exit code 0 no longer means only "the agent ended itself cleanly". The [agent-absence sweep](#a-session-whose-agent-exited-under-a-surviving-shell) also writes 0 when it retires a session whose agent vanished under a live shell, and its trigger set is wider than `/exit`: a CLI crash and a failed launch land there too. So a retirement is never resurrected here, whatever ended the agent. That is deliberate (the alternative resurrects the conversation a user deliberately exited), but note the resulting asymmetry: a crash that KILLS the shell reports an abnormal code and IS recovered, while a crash that leaves the shell alive is reported as 0 and is not.
4. **Deduplicate per `(task_id, isolated_swimlane_id)`** -- keep only the latest record for each parallel session (see [Isolated Sessions](#isolated-sessions-per-column-session-model)), mark older same-session duplicates as `exited`. A task may hold multiple sessions; only same-session duplicates are retired.
5. **Select the current session** -- per task, recover ONLY the session matching the task's current column strategy (`resolveIsolatedSwimlaneId`). Non-target sessions are preserved (an orphaned or interrupted-exited one is CAS-upgraded to `suspended`) so re-entering their column later continues their own conversation.
6. **Filter** -- skip tasks in non-auto-spawn columns (an interrupted-exited record there is CAS-upgraded to `suspended` for future resume, mirroring move-to-Done), skip user-paused sessions (`suspended_by = 'user'`), skip missing CWD, skip deleted/archived tasks. Skipped does NOT mean invisible: a record that ends up `suspended` in a non-auto-spawn **custom** column gets a `registerSuspendedPlaceholder` entry, because the renderer derives the Resume control and the card's click target from its in-memory session list, not the DB. Without one the task presents exactly like a To Do card (click opens the edit form, no Resume anywhere) even though `SESSION_RESUME` would happily resume it. To Do and Done are excluded by ROLE, not by the `auto_spawn` flag: both deliberately hide Resume, and a To Do card relies on having no session so it opens straight into the edit form. The placeholder is idempotent per task: a live or suspended row already in the registry blocks it, and an exited row is replaced. Recovery can run twice for a project in one process (an explicit `PROJECT_OPEN` while startup activation is still working on that project), and a second placeholder used to survive the eventual spawn and sit ahead of the live PTY in the renderer's session list, which painted "Resume session" over a running agent. The in-memory registry holds ONE row per task (the task's current session; the DB keeps its other resumable records), and every spawn drains all of the task's registry rows, not the first match, to keep it that way.
7. **Resume or respawn** (isolation-scoped via `getLatestForTaskByTypeAndIsolation`):
   - Suspended/orphaned/interrupted-exited with `agent_session_id` -- use `--resume` (attempts to restore conversation; the id is first reconciled against the record's own `status.json`, see [Resume](#resume))
   - No session ID -- fresh `--session-id` with prompt from matching `spawn_agent` action
8. **Reconcile** -- spawn fresh agents for tasks in auto_spawn columns with no session at all (skips user-paused tasks); fresh rows are tagged with the column's `isolated_swimlane_id`

## Isolated Sessions (Per-Column Session Model)

A task can run on multiple parallel, independently-resumable sessions. Two orthogonal column fields control the behavior; the pure rules live in `src/main/transition-engine/session-isolation.ts`. Only the first is offered in the UI, on the Column Manager's Conversation card: `session_spawn_strategy` is derived from it by `resolveForceFresh` and is settable by hand in `kangentic.json` only (see [configuration.md](configuration.md#swimlane-level-configuration) for why the two combinations that derivation does not reach are both bad).

- **`session_target`** (`main` | `isolated`, default `main`) - which session track a task runs on. `main` is the task's shared main conversation (resumed as the task moves between normal columns); `isolated` is this column's own separate, context-isolated session, keyed by the swimlane id. Resolved by `resolveSessionTarget` / `resolveIsolatedSwimlaneId`; the discriminator is `sessions.isolated_swimlane_id` (`NULL` = main, swimlane id = isolated).
- **`session_spawn_strategy`** (`create_or_resume` | `always_spawn_new`, default `create_or_resume`) - what to do with that track on entry. `create_or_resume` resumes the track's session if one exists, else spawns it; `always_spawn_new` always spawns fresh, retiring the prior session for that `(task, target)`. Read by `resolveForceFresh`, which is a plain comparison for any stored column: the DB column is `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'create_or_resume'` and `SwimlaneRepository.create` writes a concrete string, so the context-aware fallback in that function never evaluates for a real lane and survives only for a partial object.

  **"Isolated means a fresh pass each entry" is enforced by the WRITERS, not the resolver.** The two interactive writers pair the fields through one shared rule, `snapSpawnStrategyToTarget` (`src/shared/session-track.ts`): moving a column to `isolated` carries its strategy to `always_spawn_new`, and back to `main` returns it to `create_or_resume`, in both cases only when the strategy still sits at the outgoing track's default, so a deliberate pairing survives. The Column Manager's Session select and the MCP `create_column` / `update_column` handlers both call it, which is what keeps an agent-created review column identical to a hand-made one. The `kangentic.json` sync does NOT pair them: `apply-config.ts` applies each key as written. An app-written file always carries both, since `build-config.ts` emits both whenever either is non-default, but a hand-edited one naming only `sessionTarget: isolated` lands as `isolated` + `create_or_resume`.

The four combinations:

| `session_target` | `session_spawn_strategy` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | `create_or_resume` | Resume the task's main session, or start it (the default) |
| `main` | `always_spawn_new` | Restart the main session from scratch each entry (reset-main) |
| `isolated` | `create_or_resume` | Resume this column's isolated session, or start it (a persistent isolated track) |
| `isolated` | `always_spawn_new` | A fresh, independent pass every entry (the reviewer archetype) |

Both fields are enums so future tracks/strategies need no schema migration.

**An isolated session is context-isolated.** It does NOT inherit the main session's conversation. This is the point of the feature: pairing `session_target: isolated` (with the default `always_spawn_new`) and `auto_command: /code-review` yields an independent reviewer that judges the current diff without the generator's reasoning trail. (This is distinct from Claude Code's own `/fork` / `--fork-session`, which *inherit* the conversation; we deliberately do not.) "Restart the conversation" within a session is otherwise left to the agent's native `/clear` / `/compact`.

**One active PTY per task** is preserved. The worktree is shared across a task's sessions (same `task.worktree_path`), so an isolated session's edits are real and persist; the main session sees the changed tree but not the isolated conversation.

**`always_spawn_new` applies on column entry only.** An app restart / pause-resume of an in-progress session still resumes it (the recovery path is unaffected), so a crash never discards active work.

Lifecycle on task move (`task-move.ts`, the session switch branch inside Priority 3):

- **Enter an isolated column from a live main session**: suspend the main session (preserve `agent_session_id`), then Phase 3 spawns/resumes the isolated session and runs its `auto_command`. With `always_spawn_new` (the isolated default) it spawns fresh each entry, retiring the prior pass.
- **Leave an isolated column for a normal column**: suspend the isolated session (resumable), then Phase 3 resumes the **main** session.
- **Reset-main / recycle**: an `always_spawn_new` column forces a fresh spawn on its target track even when the live session is already on that track, so the switch fires on `resolveForceFresh(toLane)`, not only on a target change.
- The target + spawn policy are derived from the destination column in `resolveSpawnOverrides`, threaded through `SpawnOverrides.isolatedSwimlaneId` / `SpawnOverrides.forceFresh` into `resolveSpawnIntent` (which retires the prior record on a forced-fresh entry) and `sessionRepo.insert`. The terminal tab badges an isolated session as "Isolated" vs "Main".

## Shutdown

On app close, the `before-quit` handler (`createBeforeQuitHandler` in `src/main/pty/shutdown/before-quit-handler.ts`, wired in `src/main/index.ts`) calls `syncShutdownCleanup()` (`src/main/shutdown.ts`), which is fully synchronous. The `suspendAll()` method exists in `SessionManager` but is **never called during shutdown**: it is async and would break the synchronous requirement.

The actual shutdown sequence (`syncShutdownCleanup()` in `src/main/shutdown.ts`):

1. Cancel all pending command injections
2. List all in-memory sessions with `running` or `queued` status
3. For each running record, call `captureSessionMetrics()` (synchronous: in-memory cache read + better-sqlite3 writes) so cost / tokens / duration / `tool_breakdown` / `compaction_count` are flushed to the DB before the PTY is killed. The function writes to BOTH the `sessions` row (`SessionRepository.updateMetrics`) and, when `usage` is defined, to a `usage_history` row (`UsageHistoryRepository.recordSessionUsage`) so lifetime period totals survive any subsequent task deletion. Without this step every clean app close loses in-flight metrics for any session that had not yet checkpointed. (The shutdown path uses the synchronous snapshot only; the async transcript-token refinement, `refineTranscriptTokens`, runs only on the exit/suspend/move paths, never here.) A periodic snapshot timer (`startMetricsSnapshotTimer`, ~45s) also runs this same capture for live sessions during normal operation so an app/OS kill bounds the loss to one interval; it is stopped synchronously at the top of `syncShutdownCleanup`.
4. Mark each running record `suspended` (with `suspended_at` timestamp and `suspended_by = 'system'`) so sessions can resume on next launch. Queued records are marked `exited` since there is nothing to resume.
5. Call `SessionManager.killAll({ allowGrace })` which writes each PTY's exit sequence and force-kills it immediately (no waiting), except that a YOUNG session (see the `kill()` grace above) is parked on the deferred registry's 1500 ms timer when `allowGrace` is set, which it is only on a route the drain follows (a user quit, the powerMonitor shutdown; never a Windows `session-end` or a signal, which flush every parked PTY at once). Then `sessionManager.dispose()`, which leaves the parked PTYs alone
6. Clean up session files and clear in-memory session maps
7. Delete ephemeral project from index (if applicable)
8. Close all database connections via `closeAll()`
9. Return the `PtyKillReport` for the PTYs `killAll()` killed: the probe-able child pids, the total kill count, and `deferredCount` (how many ride the grace timer)

Every cleanup step before the kill runs through `runCleanupStep`, which logs `[SHUTDOWN] cleanup:step-failed <name>` and continues. A throwing handle-closer used to abort the whole `try` and leave every PTY alive, which hangs Electron's teardown until the 6 second failsafe, because node-pty's ThreadSafeFunction finalizer joins the thread waiting on the child. The one bare call in that region is the `getSessionManager()` read, which is not a cleanup step: a throw there leaves no manager to kill PTYs with either way. Steps 7 and 8 are wrapped too, so a read-only global index DB cannot skip `closeAll()` and leak SQLite handles into the quit.

Then, only when at least one PTY was killed, the handler calls `event.preventDefault()` and runs the bounded PTY exit-callback drain (`drainPtyExitCallbacks` in `src/main/pty/shutdown/exit-callback-drain.ts`): it polls the killed pids every 25 ms until every one is gone, allows 100 ms of further loop turns, gives up at 1500 ms (plus the 1500 ms kill grace when `deferredCount` is above zero, since a deferred kill lands exactly at the grace), and then calls `app.quit()` again. A kill whose child pid was unreadable has no probe, so the drain spends a fixed 400 ms blind budget for it instead. The second `before-quit` pass is a no-op and Electron's normal quit proceeds (tearing down Chromium child processes). The drain logs `[SHUTDOWN] pty-drain:start n=<probed> blind=<unprobed>` (with ` deferred=<n>` appended when a kill rides the grace timer) and `pty-drain:done <ms>` (or `pty-drain:timeout <ms> lingering=<pids> blind=<n>`). It exists because node-pty delivers a PTY's exit through a native ThreadSafeFunction, and an exit callback first dispatched after Electron has stopped Node kills the process with an unhandled C++ exception (Sentry DESKTOP-C); the drain makes sure those callbacks land while JS is still callable.

The count, not just the pid list, is what arms the drain: an empty pid list must never read as "no PTY was killed" when one was killed and could not be named.

Every path that skips the drain says so: `pty-drain:skip reason=no-pty-killed`, and `pty-drain:skip reason=os-initiated-shutdown` for a Windows `session-end`, which Electron documents as unpreventable. The macOS/Linux powerMonitor `shutdown` event does NOT skip: Electron documents a `preventDefault()` there that asks the OS for time to exit cleanly, so that handler takes it, flushes, and calls `app.quit()`, and the `before-quit` that follows drains normally (logging `pty-drain:note cleanup-ran-earlier` first, since the flush already ran). The rule and its rationale: `.claude/rules/synchronous-shutdown.md`.

A hard failsafe timer (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows, 6 seconds) runs as a backstop in case Electron's shutdown hangs.

Sessions are resumable on next launch via `--resume <agent_session_id>` from the saved DB record. The 2-second graceful `/exit` window is intentionally sacrificed for mature sessions to keep shutdown synchronous and prevent zombie processes; a young session keeps its 1500 ms grace because the timer runs inside the drain, which the quit already waits on.

## Terminal Ownership Handoff

- Each PTY session spawns exactly one Claude Code CLI process.
- The bottom panel and the modeless task-detail windows share that process, one xterm per session at a time.
- `dialogSessionIds: string[]` in `SessionStore` lists every session owned by an open task-detail window, in ANY window-manager layer (board, Command Terminal, Agent Monitor). It replaced the scalar `dialogSessionId` once task detail became modeless and windows can stack. It is one array per renderer, so `useWindowSessionClaims` reconciles it across all layers at once.
- When a window claims a session: the panel unmounts that session's xterm instance AND drops its tab, so a detached task leaves no tab that would select an empty pane. The panel keeps every other tab live; it collapses only once no tab is left (`derivePanelSessions` + `shouldForceCollapseTerminal`).
- When the window releases it: the tab returns, still selected, and the panel recreates xterm from the PTY scrollback buffer.
- This prevents duplicate xterm instances from sending conflicting resize calls.
- Both surfaces can therefore hold a live terminal at once, so `deriveFocusedSessionIds` focuses the window-owned sessions AND the panel's own session; anything with a mounted xterm must be in that set or the main process suppresses its PTY output.
- **Which of those terminals takes KEYBOARD focus when it arrives is arbitrated, not raced**
  (`src/renderer/utils/terminal-arrival-focus.ts`). The handoff above is exactly what creates the
  race: opening a detail claims its session, so the panel drops that tab and mounts a terminal for a
  DIFFERENT session at the same moment the window mounts its own. Both then fetch scrollback, which
  main delays 150-400ms for the repaint settle, and every arrival path used to end in an
  unconditional `xterm.focus()` - so whichever replay resolved LAST won, and a user who opened a
  task and started typing could have the keystrokes land in whatever agent the panel fell back to.
  `mayTakeArrivalFocus(sessionId, site)` decides from user-intent STATE instead, in four tiers:
  a claim recorded by a gesture that named a terminal before it existed (a panel tab click, a panel
  expand - the panel is not a window, so neither moves any layer's `focusedWindowId`); else a
  window an AGENT opened or raised, which denies EVERYONE including its own terminal while it
  holds focus (`openedByAgent`, see `.claude/rules/agent-driven-focus.md`); else the
  terminal-hosting window holding window-layer focus, resolved by ANCHOR across all three layers
  via `resolveFocusedWindowTerminal` in `dictation-target.ts`; else, when nothing owns the user's
  attention, allow unless focus is in a typing surface. A claim is NOT consumed on grant, because
  one arrival legitimately fires focus more than once (the deferred-init frame, then the mount
  replay); a later window-focus change (the fingerprint) or the TTL is what ends it. Tiers 1 and 2
  DENY a mismatch outright rather than falling through, which is what stops two terminals arriving
  in one frame from both being permitted - including the case where the focused window has not
  spawned a session yet, which still blocks everyone else. Tier 3 has no mismatch to deny, so its
  own guard is a 500ms burst hold (`ARRIVAL_BURST_MS`): several terminals can reach it together on a
  workspace restore that persisted no focused window, and only the first wins. Hosts own the policy
  and pass it to `useTerminal` as an option, so the hook stays
  surface-agnostic. Genuinely user-initiated focus (frame pointer-down, file drop, maximize
  re-homing) is unconditional and marked `// arrival-focus-ok:`. See
  `.claude/rules/terminal-arrival-focus.md`.
- **The arrival is an obligation the replay owes, not a moment it passes through.** A replay arms
  it at START and discharges it via `focusOnArrival`: the two normal completions, plus the three
  that PRE-EMPT one - the stuck-replay watchdog (`SCROLLBACK_WATCHDOG_MS`) and the two IPC
  rejections. The one deliberate exception is a `skipFocus` reload, which does not discharge, since
  letting a reveal or refocus catch-up answer an arrival would move focus on a park/reveal edge
  that is not an arrival at all. Without that, a pre-empted replay took its
  focus decision down with it: the watchdog bumps the replay generation, so the replay's own
  `afterWrite` returns above the frame that asks the arbiter, and it clears the pending flag, which
  lifts the replay veil. The terminal then looks fully arrived and merely unfocusable, while the
  arbiter was in fact never consulted - and nothing asks again, so it stays that way for the life
  of the terminal.
- The converse also holds: anything with NO mounted xterm must be OUT of that set. A collapsed panel renders no `TerminalTab`, so `derivePanelSessionId` returns null for it (`panelShowsTerminal`, threaded from `useTerminalResize`'s `showContent`). Otherwise main streams bytes nothing can acknowledge, and a chatty agent eventually trips backpressure (`BACKPRESSURE_HIGH_WATER`) and has its PTY paused. Output produced while collapsed accumulates in main's scrollback ring and is replayed when the panel expands and the terminal remounts. A remount is not the only way back: a session that stays MOUNTED and merely leaves the focused union (a detail window a detached monitor owns, a hidden panel, a closed command bar over a transient) is repaired on the focus edge alone, without remounting. See the focus-edge catch-up bullet under Output Streaming.

## Project-Scoped Session State

Sessions from non-active projects must not interfere with the active project's terminal panel, activity icons, or store state. This is enforced at three levels:

1. **IPC event forwarding** -- All session events (`data`, `usage`, `activity`, `event`, `status`, `removed`, `exit`) include the session's `projectId`. The renderer filters events by comparing against the current project.
2. **Cache getters** -- `getUsage`, `getActivity`, and `getEventsCache` accept an optional `projectId` parameter. When provided, `SessionManager` returns only data for sessions belonging to that project.
3. **Store scoping** -- `syncSessions()` fetches usage and events scoped to the current project, but activity unscoped (sidebar badges need cross-project data). On project switch, `activeSessionId`, `dialogSessionIds`, `openTaskId`, `sessionUsage`, and `sessionEvents` are cleared; `sessions` and `sessionActivity` are preserved for the sidebar. A generation counter invalidates any in-flight `syncSessions()` calls from the previous project, and a snapshot-based merge preserves IPC-delivered status updates that arrive during the async gap.

**Sidebar exception:** Activity state (`thinking`/`idle`) is always forwarded and stored regardless of project, so the sidebar can show badge counts for all projects. Auto-focus and sync triggers are gated to the current project only.

## Transcript Capture

PTY output is captured for two purposes: terminal display (via the scrollback buffer) and persistent transcript storage (via `TranscriptWriter`).

`TranscriptWriter` (`src/main/pty/buffer/transcript-writer.ts`) receives raw PTY data, strips ANSI escape sequences, and debounces writes to the `session_transcripts` table every 30 seconds, flushing early if a session's pending buffer exceeds 256KB. This provides a clean, searchable text transcript of the session without terminal formatting noise.

The transcript is used during cross-agent handoff: when a task moves to a column with a different agent, the `HandoffOrchestrator` reads the transcript from the database, combines it with git diff and session metrics, and packages it as handoff context for the new agent.

## Cross-Agent Handoff

When a task moves to a column where `resolveTargetAgent()` returns a different agent than the current session:

1. The current session is suspended (Priority 3a in the [Transition Engine](transition-engine.md))
2. The `HandoffOrchestrator` packages context: session transcript (from `session_transcripts`), git diff (changed files), and session metrics (tokens, cost, duration)
3. A new session is spawned with the target agent, receiving a `handoffPromptPrefix` summarizing the previous agent's work
4. A `handoff-context.md` file is written to the new session directory for reference
5. A `handoffs` record is inserted in the database tracking the from/to agents, sessions, and the full context packet

The handoff is transparent to the user - the task card shows spawn progress phases (`packaging-handoff`, `detecting-agent`, `starting-agent`) and the shimmer overlay lifts when the new agent's TUI is ready.

## Output Streaming

- PTY `onData` accumulates into a per-session buffer.
- A 16ms flush interval (~60fps) emits buffered data via IPC `session:data`.
- A 512KB scrollback ring buffer per session supports terminal restoration.
- **Alt-screen sessions - and non-alt sessions whose byte ring spans an effective geometry
  change - replay the parsed grid, not the byte tail.** A raw byte replay is not a
  frame snapshot: a fullscreen TUI leaves write-once static cells (box rules, mode labels)
  undrawn after a clear, so once a session outgrows the 512KB ring their drawing bytes are gone
  and a remount at unchanged geometry (no SIGWINCH, so no fresh repaint) paints a permanently
  holed frame. A multi-geometry ring is the normal-buffer twin of that problem: Claude Code's
  default (non-fullscreen) renderer is a TUI in the normal buffer addressing rows absolutely
  per-geometry, and Windows ConPTY re-emits even plain shell output the same way, so replaying
  bytes drawn at one grid into an xterm at another lands stale CUP writes mid-history and
  interleaves two frames' text on one row. `PtyBufferManager.getReplaySnapshot` therefore
  serves the headless PARSED grid (the same serialized frame `getSerializedFrame` gives the
  mobile seed) when the session is in the alt screen or its ring is geometry-suspect, and the
  raw byte replay for stable-geometry non-alt sessions - a plain shell's scrollback IS the
  bytes, and truncation there only loses old history. The gate
  (`BufferState.geometryChangedAtRingIndex`) is armed by an effective resize while the ring
  holds bytes, shifted down by ring trims, and cleared once the suspect prefix trims out, so a
  long-lived session self-heals back to the full-history byte replay; a respawn carries it
  across via `initSession`'s `previousGeometry` (conservatively marking the carried ring
  suspect when the prior drawn-at geometry is unknown or changed). The pre-TUI strip is
  mirrored beyond the byte replay too, in two layers. The SOURCE layer: an agent spawn's
  typed command line is prefixed with the shell's own clear
  (`buildSpawnClearPrelude`: `Clear-Host; ` / `cls & ` / `clear; `; transient Command
  Terminals skip it), so the shell erases its startup preamble and command echo the instant
  the command executes - a real clear in the real byte stream that every consumer (live
  terminal, ring, parser, replays, phone) honors natively, immune to pwsh/ConPTY updates
  reshaping their startup bytes. The DETECTION layer: a fresh session's TUI-takeover clear
  (the first NORMAL-buffer `\x1b[2J` PRECEDED by printable output - ConPTY's own escape-only
  startup clear must not consume the one-shot) injects an `\x1b[3J` (erase scrollback only)
  into the HEADLESS PARSER's stream and the LIVE FLUSH buffer (never the ring) and stamps
  `tuiStartIndex` at the same boundary, so neither a serialized frame nor a terminal that
  was already mounted at spawn resurrects the echo. The two layers are deliberately
  INDEPENDENT, not chained: pwsh's `Clear-Host` renders through ConPTY as per-row erases
  plus `\x1b[3J` with no `\x1b[2J` at all, so the prelude cleans every consumer purely
  in-stream while the detection layer keys on whichever real `2J` the TUI itself emits -
  either alone suffices. The one-shot is bounded to the spawn: transient Command Terminals
  never arm it (no spawn echo to strip, and a user shell's later `\x1b[2J` - viewport-only by
  spec - must not be upgraded into a scrollback wipe), and it expires after a takeover window
  (`PRE_TUI_TAKEOVER_WINDOW_MS`) so a mid-session repaint clear can never fire it against
  genuine accumulated history. Alt-screen sessions skip the
  injection (no user-visible scrollback to protect), and a carried-over ring opts out
  exactly like `tuiStartIndex` does, so a respawn's first clear cannot wipe genuine carried
  history. Every parser on this
  path - the headless grid,
  the renderer xterm that replays it, and the hand-rolled `VirtualScreen` probes - runs the
  Unicode 11 width table via `src/shared/xterm-unicode11.ts`, because xterm's default V6 table
  scores emoji single-width and drifts every autowrapped row of an agent TUI frame one column
  per emoji (see `.claude/rules/xterm-unicode11-parity.md`).
- **Do not trim the byte replay to the last full-screen clear.** Tried and reverted: it cut a
  512KB ring to ~1.5KB but produced a permanently black terminal on a fast open/close/reopen.
  Slicing at the last clear discards write-once cells, and a sample landing at or just after a
  clear replays a clear with nothing after it. The parsed-grid snapshot above is the safe shape,
  not a byte-offset heuristic; and since the byte path now serves stable-geometry normal-buffer
  sessions, a trim there would discard genuine user-scrollable history, not just a TUI's redraw
  bytes.
- **One grid width per mount (deterministic fit).** `describeProposedDimensions`
  (`src/renderer/addons/fit-addon.ts`, the single implementation that both `proposeDimensions` and
  `fit` read) is a pure function of two inputs and no others: the container geometry, and the ACTIVE
  renderer's cell metric. It must not read anything else that can change while a terminal is
  mounting, because every distinct column count costs a PTY resize and a full agent
  repaint the user watches land. Holding the second input still across a mount or a reveal is the
  next bullet's subject. The rule exists because the fit used to reclaim the scrollbar
  gutter whenever the alternate screen buffer was active: the scrollback replay writes the TUI's
  alt-screen enter mid-mount, so the mount fit and the post-replay refit disagreed by two columns on
  every open (always, under Claude Code's `/tui fullscreen`). That produced the "opens mis-sized,
  then refits" flash, and its stacked-repaint race intermittently left the terminal black with
  correct dimensions. xterm's own stylesheet sets `.xterm-viewport { overflow-y: scroll }`, so the
  gutter is reserved in the alt buffer too; it is now MEASURED (`offsetWidth - clientWidth`) rather
  than assumed, which is both correct and constant across buffer modes. The old hardcoded 14px
  against the real 8px gutter was the actual cause of the empty right-hand strip that the
  alt-buffer reclaim was mistakenly written to fix. Gated by
  `tests/e2e/terminal-fit-invariant.spec.ts` (one distinct grid width per open, and the grid never
  wider than its viewport) and `tests/unit/fit-addon.test.ts`.
- **Fit only on the renderer the terminal keeps.** The container is not the fit's only input: the
  cell metric is, and that comes from whichever renderer is attached
  (`_renderService.dimensions.css.cell.width`). Parking a terminal disposes its WebGL addon for the
  GPU budget, and the DOM renderer it falls back to measures a WIDER cell, so an unchanged container
  proposes ~10% FEWER columns while suspended (measured: 210 attached, 191 suspended, at
  hostWidth 1483). `useFocusedSessionsSync` therefore applies the WebGL attachment plan BEFORE it
  publishes the parked set, because `syncParkedTerminals` fires reveal listeners synchronously and
  each one fits itself on the spot; the mount path already had this order
  (`attachWebglRenderer`, then the initial fit). With the order inverted, a Board -> Backlog ->
  Board round trip wrote main's full-width frame into the narrow grid and the refit widened it back
  WITHOUT reflowing - xterm reflows the normal buffer on resize and never the alternate one, so a
  full-screen agent TUI stayed hard-wrapped until something forced a repaint. As a backstop for
  the other ways the width can move across a REVEAL replay's async gap, `resolveReplayWidthAction`
  (`useTerminal.ts`) compares the grid width at the write against the width after the post-write
  refit and re-issues the replay once on a mismatch. It is wired into `reloadScrollback` only. The
  mount replay has the same structural gap but is usually not exposed to it: its fit runs after the
  WebGL attach, and it sends a real resize, so main serializes at the width it fitted to. The
  exception is a mount taken while the page is already at `WEBGL_ATTACH_BUDGET` - that terminal
  starts SUSPENDED, so its fit reads the DOM cell, and the coordinator's next plan can promote it to
  WebGL mid-replay, which is the same uncovered corruption. Widening the backstop to the mount path
  is left undone deliberately. `fit()` returns an applied/declined outcome so
  a silent bail (a collapsed container, an unmeasured cell) is distinguishable from a real resize in
  the `fit` trace. Gated by `tests/unit/replay-width-invariant.test.ts` and
  `tests/ui/window-reveal-grid-width.spec.ts`, which deliberately keeps WebGL on and asserts on the
  renderer trace ring, because the specs that read terminal CONTENT pass `--disable-webgl` and so
  cannot reproduce a renderer swap at all.

  A terminal CONFORMED to a held grid (above) needs a third answer here, because the two above
  cannot reach it: it runs at a derived font, so it cannot simply re-measure its natural cell at
  the configured size the way an unheld terminal does, and the grid it probes main with would
  drift by that same ~10% across a swap. `attachWebglRenderer` therefore takes an
  `onRendererChange` callback, fired on each real flip (attach, context loss, budget suspend,
  resume), and `handleRendererChange` answers it: an unheld terminal re-measures, while a held one
  rescales its remembered natural cell by how far its conformed cell moved across the swap and
  re-conforms the held grid for the new metrics.
- **A session nobody is showing goes back to the spawn grid (the resting grid).** A PTY has ONE
  grid and every surface fits it to its own box, so a session last shown in the bottom panel was
  left at that panel's strip - measured live at 306x14 - with nothing to give it back. The agent
  then kept working in a 14-row window, and a paired phone (which mirrors the desktop grid 1:1 and
  cannot reshape a shared session) could not fill its screen from 14 rows no matter what it did
  locally. `SessionManager.scheduleRestingGridRestore` parks such a session at the RESTING GRID
  (`RESTING_GRID_COLS x RESTING_GRID_ROWS`, 210x48 - detail-shaped on purpose, not the 120x30
  spawn default: the phone mirrors the resting grid 1:1, and a phone-fitted narrow grid was
  built, live-tested, and judged LESS readable than the desktop's own layout, whose rules and
  boxes are drawn for a wide frame) after `RESTING_GRID_DELAY_MS` (1s). The park is a MOBILE
  feature and is gated on mobile interest: it fires only for a session a paired phone is actually
  streaming (`MobileTerminalProbe.hasStreamSubscriber`, answered from the bridge's per-device
  subscription registries), and a phone subscribing to a session that went unheld earlier gets an
  immediate park instead (`parkRestingGridForMobileSubscriber`, called by the read-stream
  subscribe handler BEFORE it serializes the seed, so the one snapshot already carries the
  resting grid). A desktop that never pairs never parks at all - no probe, no bridge registries,
  byte-for-byte the pre-park behavior. Three further guards make a firing park safe: it fires
  only when NOTHING holds the session - unfocused AND no renderer has an xterm mounted for it
  (`session:setMounted`, published by `terminal-mount-registry` from each terminal's own mount
  effect); it never touches a grid a phone is holding (the armed size guard consulted through
  `MobileTerminalProbe.isSizeHeld` - the guard registry, never a last-writer origin, which a
  desktop resize overwrites while the hold stays armed); and it no-ops when the PTY is already at
  the spawn grid. The park resizes with origin `'park'`, which deliberately does NOT update
  `lastDesktopDimensions`: that map is the restore target for a phone's `release-size`, and a
  park recording itself there made release "restore" the phone straight back to 120x30. After a
  release the guard teardown asks for the park decision to re-run
  (`reconsiderRestingGridAfterMobileRelease`), so an unheld session returns to the resting grid
  and the phone's next visit finds park dims again. The mounted set is the load-bearing hold: a
  PARKED terminal (Backlog view, occluded window) is unfocused but still mounted, and xterm
  re-sends dimensions only when its OWN size changes, so a PTY reshaped underneath one would
  disagree with it permanently - and the reveal deliberately skips its resize. Cost when it does
  fire: the next open of that session pays the marker settle (~20-40ms) because the grid changed
  while it was away, which is what any surface switch already pays. Gated by the `Resting grid
  restore` block in `tests/unit/session-manager.test.ts`,
  `tests/unit/terminal-mount-registry.test.ts`, and the park assertions in
  `tests/unit/mobile-bridge/{interactive-terminal,read-stream}.test.ts`.
- **A phone-streamed session is never rendered by the bottom panel, and never drops below the
  mobile row floor.** Terminal ownership is one xterm per PTY, and a phone mirrors the grid 1:1
  with no way to escape a strip-shaped fit: when the expanded bottom panel survived a
  detail-close as the owning surface, its fit took the grid to the 306x14 strip and the phone
  showed a sliver; and when the park reshaped a session under an unmounted-then-revealed panel
  xterm, the reveal's `skipResize` replay left the panel permanently mis-wrapped (both observed
  live 2026-08-02; user decision: the panel is a utility surface - the task detail is primary,
  and the phone must never inherit the strip). Three layers enforce it:
  1. **The gate is terminal-wanting subscriptions, not the bare stream key.** The phone holds a
     list-only stream subscription for EVERY live session whenever it is connected, so
     `MobileTerminalProbe.hasStreamSubscriber` answers from the `stream-terminal:<id>` marker
     that `read-stream` registers only for `terminal: true` subscribes (and removes on every
     release path). Gating on `stream:<id>` made the park fire for the entire board.
  2. **The panel drops the tab of a phone-streamed session entirely.** Main pushes the
     terminal-streamed set to the renderer (`MobileBridgeService.terminalStreamedSessionIds`,
     `mobile:terminalStreamsChanged`, mirrored by `useMobileTerminalStreamsSync`), and
     `derivePanelSessions` folds it into the `owned` exclusion - the same no-tab treatment a
     detail-owned session gets, so no panel fit ever contends with the park, and the focused
     set, the parked/reveal plan, and the WebGL budget all follow from the shared derivation.
     No placeholder (user decision 2026-08-02): the user watching that session is on their
     phone, not at the desk, and the tab returns the moment the phone lets go. A task-detail
     window still mounts a real terminal: the detail is primary and its grid wins while open.
  3. **`SessionManager` backstops the races** (`MOBILE_USABLE_MIN_ROWS`, 20): `resize()`
     REFUSES a desktop-origin resize below the floor while a phone streams (before
     `bufferManager.onResize`, so the headless parser never diverges from the real PTY; the
     refused grid still records `lastDesktopDimensions` as the restore target), and
     `parkRestingGridForMobileSubscriber` overrides a desktop HOLD below the floor, rescuing a
     phone that subscribes to a session the strip captured before the phone arrived.
  A desktop with no terminal-streaming phone never hits any layer: the panel renders and owns
  grids exactly as before the park existed. Gated by the floor tests in the `Resting grid
  restore` block of `tests/unit/session-manager.test.ts`, the terminal-marker tests in
  `tests/unit/mobile-bridge/read-stream.test.ts`, the change-hook test in
  `tests/unit/mobile-bridge/subscription-registry.test.ts`, and `panelTerminalSessionIdFor` in
  `tests/unit/focused-sessions.test.ts`.
- **The width-drift self-heal (PTY dims echo + owner re-assert).** xterm re-sends its dimensions
  only when its OWN size changes, so a PTY reshaped under a mounted xterm (a lost or overridden
  resize on a surface flip, a respawn at stashed dims, any last-writer-wins race - `resize()`
  carries no surface identity) used to diverge with NO recovery path: with the Windows
  full-repaint flag every frame is absolute-positioned at the PTY width, so the mounted grid
  rendered a staircase (rows shifted progressively right, labels clipped) until the window was
  resized by hand. Main now broadcasts `session:ptyResized` (`SESSION_PTY_RESIZED`) whenever the
  PTY's grid ACTUALLY changes - the same-dims short-circuit runs first, so the echo of a
  terminal's own resize always carries its own dims - with the resize's origin
  (`PtyResizeOrigin`: `desktop`/`mobile`/`park`/`spawn`). It is a broadcast, not a focus-routed
  push: a freshly mounted xterm can miss a routed echo during exactly the mount window where a
  divergence is born, and echoes only fire on real grid changes. The mounted owner's listener
  (`useTerminal`) compares the echoed dims to its own and, when they disagree, re-asserts its
  fitted grid after a 150ms coalescing debounce and repairs the already-garbled frame with a
  `reloadScrollback({ skipResize: true })` replay (the resize it just sent armed the repaint
  settle, so the reload samples the frame drawn at the corrected width). The guard matrix is the
  pure `resolvePtyEchoReassert` (exported from `useTerminal.ts`): in-sync self-filter first,
  then foreign-hold (`mobile`/`park` origins - a phone or the park legitimately holds the grid;
  `spawn` is healable), refused-hold (see below), parked, replay-in-flight, own-resize-pending,
  and last a TIME-WINDOWED budget (2 re-asserts per divergence signature per 10s) - deliberately
  not reset by an in-sync echo, because in a two-surface fight each side's successful re-assert
  lands an in-sync echo at the other side, so a reset-on-heal budget never binds in exactly the
  livelock it exists to bound. `resize()` also reports `refused: true` from the mobile sub-floor
  branch (the one path where main deliberately holds the grid against the caller), which arms a
  time-stamped refusal hold after a single refused IPC: no further re-asserts for the budget
  window, whatever dims later echoes carry (time-stamped rather than signature-keyed, because
  the pre-send fit can move the terminal's own dims and a burned signature would stop binding
  exactly then). The refusal also names the grid main keeps (`SessionResizeResult.held`), and
  the terminal CONFORMS to it (`conformToHeldGrid` in `useTerminal.ts`): it resizes its own
  xterm to the held grid and scales its font DOWN to fit that grid into the pane, letterboxed
  and never above the configured size (`CONFORM_MAX_SCALE` is 1), so the frame the PTY paints
  is the frame the user sees rather than the taller grid clipped. A
  held terminal keeps probing main with the grid it would fit on its own, and the first accepted
  probe releases the hold and restores the configured font. Only the container fit probes
  (`fitTerminal`'s probe argument, passed true by the `fit()` callback alone): a replay, a reload,
  or a renderer swap re-conforms the held grid without asking main anything.
  A conform that the pane cannot show (the grid needs type below the 4 px floor, the box cannot
  be measured, or the step-down budget runs out before the grid fits) is DECLINED: the hold is
  released and the terminal keeps its own fit, rather than committing a font size nothing
  verified. The web demo's mock holds a replayed session at its recording's grid through the same
  answer (demo/README.md, "Live replay"). Gated by `tests/ui/terminal-held-grid-conform.spec.ts`.

  Every renderer resize sender now traces `resize-request` with an origin
  tag (`mount`/`flush`/`reload`/`echo-reassert`/`debounced-onResize`) and main traces every
  resize outcome (`resize-applied`/`resize-noop`/`resize-refused`/`resize-stash`/
  `resize-ignored`/`resize-invalid`/`resize-failed` (node-pty threw on a just-died child; main
  records the failure and returns `{ colsChanged }` rather than rejecting the renderer's invoke),
  plus `resize-reassert`/`resize-reassert-failed` from the post-boot re-assert below), so
  `kangentic_devtools_terminal_state`'s merged trace
  names the trigger if a divergence ever recurs. A resize for a queued or suspended session
  stashes (including suspend's marked-but-alive teardown window, where the PTY is still
  non-null but must not be reshaped or re-echoed); one for a missing or exited session is
  ignored. Gated by `tests/unit/pty-resize-echo-reassert.test.ts` (the guard
  matrix), the emit/refusal pins in `tests/unit/session-manager.test.ts`,
  `tests/ui/terminal-resize-echo-reassert.spec.ts` (real xterm wiring: re-assert, repair,
  self-echo no-op, budget bound), and `tests/e2e/terminal-width-drift-selfheal.spec.ts` (a real
  PTY driven to the incident by a rogue `sessions.resize`, healed back to the owner grid).
- **Post-boot geometry re-assert (the spawn-window race).** ConPTY only delivers a
  resize to a connected client, so a resize applied while the agent is still booting (the fit
  lands ~140ms after `pty.spawn`) can be lost, leaving the child composing at the 120-column
  spawn width inside the fitted grid while `ptyMatchesGrid`/`colsDrift` read healthy. `resize()`
  arms `ManagedSession.resizeAppliedBeforeTuiReady` when it applies a resize while the stream is
  not in the alt buffer - NOT keyed on the first-output latch, which a shell preamble can
  trip seconds before the agent exists (pwsh 7.6's preamble carries the cursor-hide escape the
  adapters match; this shipped as a live recurrence of task #573 on 2026-08-30). Two triggers
  then re-deliver the geometry as a jiggle
  (`cols-1`, then `cols` back, traced `resize-reassert` with its `trigger`): the first-output
  latch (disarming only when the output provably came from the TUI) and the stream's first
  alt-screen entry via `PtyBufferManager`'s `onAltScreenEnter` (which nothing but the TUI can
  produce, always disarming). The arming criterion is the stream's CURRENT alt-screen state, not
  a once-ever latch, so a booted TUI resized during a normal-buffer excursion (`\x1b[?1049l`, or
  an RIS `\x1bc`) re-arms and re-jiggles on its next re-entry; that costs one redundant
  re-delivery of geometry the child already holds, and is accepted rather than tracked. Both call
  direct `pty.resize()` -
  deliberately bypassing `resize()`'s ladder, whose same-dims short-circuit would eat the
  restore leg and whose broadcasts would churn the echo budget, phone re-seeds, and settle for
  net-unchanged geometry. The third-layer diagnostic (`composedCols`/`composedMatchesPty` on
  `kangentic_devtools_terminal_state`) measures the width the child actually composes at from
  its raw ring, alt-screen sessions only. Pinned by the `Post-boot geometry re-assert`
  block in `tests/unit/session-manager.test.ts` and the respawn latch-cleanup tests in
  `tests/unit/session-spawn-flow.test.ts`; the diagnostic is exercised by
  `tests/unit/composed-width.test.ts` and `tests/unit/devtools-terminal-state.test.ts`.
- **Repaint-settled scrollback sampling.** A session spawns at a default 120x30; on a cold launch
  an auto-resumed PTY sits at that size until a card opens and the renderer fits it wider. When a
  geometry-changing resize fires (cols OR rows), a full-screen agent TUI repaints its frame
  asynchronously in response to SIGWINCH. So `getScrollback` waits for that repaint to land and
  quiesce before sampling (`PtyBufferManager.waitForResizeRepaint`), so a terminal restored right
  after a resize replays the frame at the fitted geometry instead of a stale one. Width armed the
  settle first; rows-only changes (a bottom-panel height drag, a vertical-only window resize) arm
  it too since a 2026-07-31 live measurement: 12/12 trials sampled the old-row-count frame before
  the repaint, and the rows repaint always arrived 21-122ms later carrying a full `\x1b[2J` erase,
  so the marker settles the wait early rather than riding the ceiling. (The resize IPC's
  `colsChanged` report is unchanged - arming widened internally; nothing on the renderer or the
  mobile wire consumes a rows flag.) A ring with NO `\x1b[2J` anywhere takes a
  short wait of its own rather than the old instant sample: "no marker" at mount time also
  describes a fullscreen TUI that has not drawn its first frame yet (observed live as a 237-byte
  replay where a settled mount replays hundreds of KB), so the no-marker path samples on a
  post-resize erase (the first frame just landed), on a marker-less quiesce, or - for a session
  that answers SIGWINCH with silence, i.e. a plain shell - after a small grace
  (`NO_MARKER_SILENT_GRACE_MS`), bounded by `NO_MARKER_MAX_WAIT_MS` far below the TUI ceiling so
  Command Terminal opens stay fast. The wait is skipped entirely when the session has no live PTY
  (a suspended, killed, or pre-spawn session can never receive a SIGWINCH repaint, so the wait
  would only burn its deadline), and is bounded by a max-wait ceiling, so a missing or
  slow repaint can only delay a first paint, never hang the read. An actively streaming session
  never quiesces, so the wait also settles EARLY the moment a full-frame repaint marker lands in
  the bytes appended after the resize, outside any open synchronized-output frame - instead of
  burning the whole ceiling and sampling mid-repaint. The marker is the `\x1b[2J` erase ONLY: a
  bare `\x1b[H` cursor-home was tried and reverted, since TUIs emit it for ordinary partial
  updates (a live session showed 169 cursor-homes to 56 erases). A MARKER-LESS repaint no longer
  rides the whole ceiling: past `MARKERLESS_REPAINT_MIN_WAIT_MS` (a floor above the measured
  21-122ms marker-arrival window, so a genuine erase still wins) post-resize bytes that have
  quiesced settle the wait, because Claude's default renderer repaints WITHOUT an erase while
  idle (measured 2026-08-26: 12/12 idle detail opens rode the deadline at 407-422ms) and a
  premature sample is no longer the raw-replay wrapped-bytes flicker - every settle-armed sample
  takes the parsed-grid route, so the worst case is a correctly-shaped slightly-stale frame the
  held live bytes then update. True post-resize silence still rides the ceiling. STACKED resizes (a second
  geometry change while a RECENT previous repaint is still pending, e.g. rapidly closing and
  reopening a task detail ping-pongs the PTY between the dialog and bottom-panel widths) disable
  the marker-only settle - the first marker may be the previous geometry's late repaint - and
  require marker AND quiesce, falling back to the ceiling while streaming. An arm older than the
  400ms ceiling does not stack the next one: by then its repaint has landed or never will (the
  settle itself stops waiting at that ceiling), so an unconsumed old arm - a height drag nothing
  sampled after - cannot slow the next open. Concurrent samplers of the SAME
  resize (a bottom-panel tab and a detail window overlapping during a handover; in dev, StrictMode's
  double mount of a Command Terminal window - both terminal hosts defer their init off the mount
  commit via the shared `useDeferredTerminalInit` hook, which lets StrictMode's
  synchronous unmount cancel the first scheduled init, so each pair collapses to a single fetch
  and no throwaway xterm races the survivor; what matters here is cancel-before-run, not which
  frame the init lands on, since the shared queue in `terminal-init-queue.ts` can push a host
  contending with others several frames out) share ONE wait: the second joins the first rather
  than starting its own. Two
  independent waits could not both work, because the first to settle clears the pending-repaint
  state that the other's early-settle scan offset points at, so the loser could never settle early
  and rode the full ceiling out - a deterministic ~415ms added to that open. A resize that arrives
  before the PTY exists (the renderer mounts before the auto-resume spawn lands) is stashed and
  applied at spawn, so the PTY starts at the fitted size and no corrective resize is needed.
  One reader deliberately OPTS OUT of this settle: `SessionManager.getOutputPeek`, which backs the
  Agent Monitor's live output peek. The settle exists so a captured frame becomes the terminal the
  user then looks at; a peek is a few throwaway lines resampled twice a second, so a mid-repaint
  sample self-corrects on the next tick, while awaiting the settle would cost up to the ceiling on
  every sample and force a synchronous read to become async. It reads the parsed grid row by row
  (`HeadlessFrameBuffer.cursorRow` / `lineAt`) rather than serializing a frame, and the line
  selection lives in `src/main/pty/buffer/output-peek.ts`.
- **DEC private mode and alt-screen re-assert on replay.** `xterm.reset()` on the renderer wipes
  every DEC private mode xterm is tracking, and the original mode-set bytes usually scroll out of
  the 512KB scrollback window on a long-running session. On the byte-replay path,
  `PtyBufferManager` tracks DEC private input/reporting modes (DECCKM, mouse tracking, bracketed
  paste, ...) from the live stream and re-asserts them as a prefix on `getScrollback` (#313), and
  a synchronized-output frame (mode 2026) left open by a mid-frame sample is closed with a
  trailing `\x1b[?2026l` so it cannot stall the renderer's ~1s safety timeout. Alt-screen (mode
  1049/47/1047) is tracked separately as `inAltScreen`; together with the geometry gate it routes
  the replay (see
  `getReplaySnapshot` above), and a session in the alt screen gets a serialized frame that carries
  its own addon-emitted alt-screen switch and mode re-asserts (mid-stream, after the serialized
  normal buffer - not a leading prefix, so nothing may `startsWith` on it), so the replay paints
  into the alt buffer with the right input modes (a replay landing in the normal buffer was
  previously the cause of a cursor left visually disconnected from the TUI frame). A
  geometry-gated NON-alt session gets the same frame shape minus the switch: the addon emits
  `\x1b[?1049h` only when the active buffer is alternate, so a never-alt frame carries none and
  replays into the normal buffer where the session lives. One mode class
  the addon cannot emit is the mouse ENCODING modes (1005/1006/1015/1016 - it re-asserts mouse
  TRACKING only), so `getReplaySnapshot` folds the tracked DEC-mode prefix onto every frame it
  serves (both routes); without
  it, a same-grid remount left xterm reporting legacy X10 mouse bytes that an SGR-expecting TUI
  ignores, and wheel scroll went dead until the TUI happened to re-assert its own modes.
  A SECOND thing the addon cannot emit is the DECSTBM scroll region: it builds its prefix from
  `terminal.modes`, and a region is two integers of buffer state rather than a mode flag, so
  `IModes` has no member for it. `HeadlessFrameBuffer.serialize` therefore appends the region
  itself plus an absolute cursor restore. Order is load-bearing twice over: the region must FOLLOW
  the frame (set before it, the frame's own row writes would scroll against it), and it must be
  followed by the CUP, because DECSTBM homes the cursor and would otherwise discard the position
  the addon's relative moves just rebuilt. The suffix is empty only when the region already spans
  the grid AND origin mode is off, which is the common case: with DECOM on it still emits a bare
  CUP, because the addon appends its own `\x1b[?6h` after its cursor restore and DECSET 6 homes
  the cursor too. Claude Code gates its own DECSTBM use on a terminal-capability probe and
  currently leaves it off under xterm.js (measured with `claude --debug`: `XTVERSION: no reply`
  then `DECSTBM: gated`, because xterm registers `CSI > c` but no `CSI > q`), so the REGION half
  guards against that gate reopening rather than repairing a live break. The origin-mode half
  repairs a live one.
  `getScrollback` itself retains the `\x1b[?1049h` prefix gate, reachable now only via direct
  byte-path reads and `getReplaySnapshot`'s serialize-deadline fallback.
- **Hold, not drop, live output across a renderer-side replay.** While a scrollback replay is in
  flight (`scrollbackPendingRef`), the renderer's incoming-write queue HOLDS (retains, does not
  ack) rather than drops live PTY bytes, and flushes them in order once the replay's `afterWrite`
  completes. This closes a window where a live diff (e.g. a fullscreen TUI's selection-highlight
  redraw) could be silently discarded during a reattach. Only the loading overlay continues to
  drop-and-ack (its window can span the whole agent startup). A generation-aware `afterWrite` and a
  bounded watchdog timer additionally guard against a stale or stuck replay leaving
  `scrollbackPendingRef` true indefinitely, which would otherwise drop all live output forever.
- **But the held bytes that PREDATE the sample are dropped, not flushed.** The hold above must not
  be read as "every held byte is flushed after the replay": bytes main flushed BEFORE the
  `getScrollback` reply are, by construction, already inside the replay whichever shape it takes
  (a byte replay: main appends to its ring and its pending buffer from the same bytes and clears
  the pending buffer when it samples; a parsed-grid frame: the serialize is atomic with the
  parser's flush barrier so every pre-sample byte is baked in, bytes racing the sample ride the
  reply as an appended tail, and main holds the session's flush ticks for the sample's duration
  so nothing can be flushed ahead of the reply), so
  flushing them afterwards repaints a pre-sample frame ON TOP of the fresh one. Because a TUI then
  sends only differential updates, nothing repairs it and the terminal shows the previous geometry's
  frame until the next SIGWINCH - a task detail opening on a session at the bottom panel's 14 rows
  showed that 14-row frame in a 48-row grid until the window was resized by hand. Both replay paths
  therefore reset the queue the moment the sample resolves, before writing it, and trace what they
  discarded (`replay-drop-held`, with a byte count). Bytes flushed AFTER the reply are post-sample
  and still held, then flushed, exactly as above. This was latent until the deferred terminal init
  collapsed `TerminalTab`'s StrictMode double mount to one terminal: the second mount's replay had
  been overwriting the stale paint.
- **A replay never leaves the terminal both blank and held.** Two rules keep an aborted replay from
  becoming a permanently black terminal. First, `reloadScrollback` clears the terminal immediately
  before writing the new frame, not before fetching it: clearing first opened a window in which only
  a SUCCESSFUL replay ever repainted, so any abort (a newer generation, a rejected read) left the
  grid empty with every byte still sitting in the main-process ring and an idle agent with no reason
  to send more. The last good frame now stays on screen until the new one replaces it. Second, the
  stuck-replay watchdog RECOVERS (re-issues the replay once, at the already-synced width) rather
  than only unblocking the queue, since unblocking a queue does not repaint a cleared grid. The
  replay lifecycle is traced (`replay-start` / `-write` / `-abort` / `-done` / `-error` /
  `-watchdog`, each with its generation) and surfaces in `kangentic_devtools_terminal_state`, so an
  abandoned replay is readable directly instead of inferred from a missing later event.
- **Focus-edge catch-up, the wider sibling of park/reveal.** Main gates PTY emission on its focused
  union, but the only catch-up repaint used to be `onTerminalReveal`, which fires on the PARKED
  edge. Parking implies unfocus, not the reverse, so every session that left the union WITHOUT
  being parked had no path back to a correct grid: a detail window a detached monitor owns
  (`remotelyOwnedSessionIds`), a hidden bottom panel, a closed command bar over a transient.
  `src/renderer/utils/focused-terminals.ts` adds the missing edge (`syncFocusedTerminals` /
  `onTerminalRefocus`, edge-triggered exactly like the parked registry), and `useTerminal`
  subscribes it to the same `reloadScrollback({ skipResize: true, skipFocus: true })` the reveal
  path uses, skipping when a replay is already in flight so a mount-time replay is never aborted
  and re-issued for the same frame. Both registries are kept: only parking additionally makes the
  incoming queue ack-and-discard, so neither subsumes the other.
- **Mouse reports are paced, never batched.** Outgoing terminal input rides a microtask write
  batcher (`src/renderer/utils/write-batcher.ts`) that coalesces synchronous onData bursts into
  one IPC write - byte-safe, but not semantics-safe for a fullscreen TUI, which treats a chunk
  as one input batch: a run of wheel reports delivered together becomes one multi-line jump, and
  the TUI's differential frame for a multi-line jump intermittently mis-assembles (the
  missing-entries family below). Verified by controlled injection (2026-08-23): ten spaced
  reports produced ten clean frames and ~29KB of output; the same ten in one chunk produced one
  ~2KB spliced frame. Unbatching alone is NOT enough - a pipe preserves no message boundaries,
  so reports written back-to-back still land in one read while the TUI renders the previous
  frame. So `useTerminal` routes every mouse report (`isMouseReport`) through `writePaced`: an
  ordered queue that writes each report as its own payload at a 16ms-per-report floor, restoring
  the physical-wheel cadence a native terminal delivers; typed bytes keep arrival order across
  the two paths, and teardown drops pending reports rather than writing them joined. The paced
  queue is bounded as well as paced: wheel reports carry a direction lane (`mouseReportLane`),
  pending same-lane depth is capped at 8 so a high-resolution flick's post-stop tail is bounded
  near 128ms instead of scaling with wheel resolution, and a same-axis, same-modifier reversal
  drops the pending opposite-direction reports as stale intent (the same philosophy as
  teardown). Motion reports (drift and drags) carry a single self-superseding lane that keeps
  only the newest pointer position: motion generates at display refresh rate, above the 16ms
  floor's 62.5/s drain, so a laneless motion stream grew the queue whenever refresh outpaced
  the floor (measured 2026-08-28 on a 143Hz display: a two-second cursor traverse left 117
  motion reports pending), and since the queue is FIFO, every wheel report and click landing
  after a traverse waited out that stale backlog - the flick-after-move lag the wheel cap
  alone could not fix. Clicks and releases are laneless, never capped or superseded (teardown
  still drops them like any pending report). The 16ms floor itself stays
  deliberately: the cap changes how many writes queue, not the per-write cadence the TUI's read
  loop needs to catch each report individually.
  (Ack-clocking each report to the TUI's answer was tried and reverted: the TUI coalesces
  repaints onto its own frame clock, so input-clocking capped scrolling at ~10Hz.) The jump a
  coalesced read still produces is bounded by keeping `CLAUDE_CODE_SCROLL_SPEED` at the CLI
  default of 1 - see [docs/cross-platform.md](cross-platform.md) for why Kangentic no longer
  raises it. This targets the wheel-scroll flavor at the source; single-report multi-line jumps
  the CLI performs internally (Ctrl+End, PageUp/Down) remain exposed and are what the repaint
  nudge below repairs.
- **Post-interaction repaint nudge.** A fullscreen TUI intermittently emits a frame that erases
  the grid and then redraws only some of it, leaving either the whole transcript blank or a
  contiguous band of rows missing mid-frame. Its renderer is differential, so it never revisits
  those rows and only a full repaint heals them, which is why a click or a resize fixes it and
  waiting does not. `src/renderer/utils/repaint-nudge.ts` asks for that repaint automatically:
  after real user input reaches a focused alt-screen terminal and the output it provoked goes
  quiet (250ms), it writes a FocusOut+FocusIn pair, which is the same report a real terminal sends
  on alt-tab and the same one the user's click was already sending. It fires on the TRIGGER rather
  than on a detected symptom, so there is no threshold to false-positive on a legitimately sparse
  frame and it covers every shape of the defect. Gated on alt-screen plus DECSET 1004 plus
  not-parked plus no-replay-pending, floored at one per 750ms per session. `isUserInputData`
  filters out xterm's OWN focus and motion reports, which arrive through the same `onData` channel
  and would otherwise self-arm a nudge on every mount replay. The before/after grid comparison is
  reporting only and never gates the nudge. A richer repair layer (resize and replay arming
  channels, a spaced focus pair, mid-burst fires, floor deferral, a persisted verdict log) was
  built, dogfooded, and removed the same day: against a producer-side defect it bought visible
  repair flicker, not correctness. Upstream: anthropics/claude-code#83714 - reproduced NATIVELY
  (PowerShell, wheel-scrolling deep into a large resumed session), so this whole family is the
  CLI renderer's, not the host's. Every host-side workaround site carries an
  `UNWIND(claude-code#83714)` marker; grep for it and sweep them out when upstream fixes the
  renderer.
- **Trace vocabulary for the two mechanisms above.** `focus-union-gained` / `focus-union-lost`
  (main, `recomputeFocusedUnion`), `terminal-unfocus` / `terminal-refocus` (renderer,
  `focused-terminals.ts`), and `repaint-repaired` / `repaint-verified` (renderer,
  `repaint-nudge.ts`, the latter meaning the frame was already correct and the nudge cost one
  render). `arrival-focus` (renderer, `terminal-arrival-focus.ts`) joins them, carrying the
  allow/deny plus the tier that decided it (`claim` / `claim-mismatch` / `agent-window` /
  `window` / `window-mismatch` / `occupied` / `burst-taken` / `unclaimed`), the `site` that asked
  (one arrival decides more than once, and they were otherwise indistinguishable), and the
  arbiter's own INPUTS: the claimed session, both fingerprints, the claim's age, and the focused
  window's session and `openedByAgent` stamp. The reason alone was not enough to diagnose with - it
  could not separate "no claim was live" from "a claim was live and its fingerprint had moved". `claimArrivalFocus` emits
  `arrival-claim` / `arrival-claim-clear` beside it, so a claim that was never made reads as a
  positive fact rather than as a missing entry. Together they are the only record of WHY a terminal
  did or did not take focus, which a "typed into the wrong terminal" report otherwise leaves to
  guesswork - and an ABSENT `arrival-focus` entry is itself a diagnosis, meaning nothing ever asked
  (see the arrival-obligation bullet above). All nine merge into
  `kangentic_devtools_terminal_state`'s timeline alongside the resize and replay events above. `kangentic_devtools_terminal_forensics` is the session-scoped
  companion: renderer viewport rows, main's re-parsed grid, and the raw byte ring side by side,
  which is what separates "the agent never sent these rows" from "we lost them".
- **Replay veil for a warm mount.** For an already-running session, `TerminalTab`'s launch overlay
  never shows (`terminalReady` starts true), so the whole mount-time fit -> replay -> refit ->
  held-byte-flush sequence used to paint live, occasionally as a visible flash. `TerminalTab` now
  covers the terminal with a veil (fixed terminal-background color, no spinner or transition) from
  mount until `useTerminal` fires its first `onScrollbackSettled` notification, so only the settled
  frame is ever shown. Every settle path (afterWrite, IPC-rejection catch, watchdog) funnels
  through one `settleScrollback` chokepoint, so the veil always lifts.

## Transient Sessions

Transient sessions are ephemeral Claude Code terminals spawned from the command bar (Ctrl+Shift+P). They differ from task-bound sessions in several ways:

- **No task association** - run at the project root with no Kanban task
- **No DB persistence** - no session record in the database
- **No resume capability** - killed on close, not suspendable
- **No queue** - spawned immediately regardless of concurrency limits

### Identity survives a renderer reload

Which Command Terminal window owns which PTY is a `(projectId, slot)` pairing held in the
renderer's `transientSessions` map. That map is renderer-only memory: HMR preserves it via
`import.meta.hot.data`, a full page reload does not. Main keeps every transient PTY running
regardless, so without recovery a reload left a live conversation with nothing pointing at it,
and the window came back as an empty fresh boot.

Main is the authority for the pairing. `ManagedSession` retains `commandTerminalSlot`,
`commandTerminalBranch`, and `commandTerminalLabel` (in memory, not a DB row, so this does not
make a transient session persistent), and `toSession` carries all three to the renderer on every
session row. `planTransientRecovery`
(`src/renderer/stores/session-store/transient-recovery.ts`) rebuilds the map from that on every
`syncSessions`, for every project:

1. An entry already pointing at a running session is kept verbatim, which preserves the
   first-prompt-wins label.
2. Every other survivor claims the slot main recorded for it.
3. A survivor whose slot is taken, or that carries none, takes the lowest free slot, so no live
   PTY is left unreachable.

Step 3 is the one case where a terminal is renumbered; see
`src/shared/command-terminal-name.ts` for why that is preferred to orphaning it. A window that
mounts before recovery runs adopts an unpaired live PTY for its slot rather than spawning
(`findAdoptableTransientSession`), so the duplicate cannot be recreated by a race.

### Spawn Flow (`SESSION_SPAWN_TRANSIENT`)

1. Resolve the target branch: the picker's choice, else the project default base
   (`resolveProjectDefaultBaseBranch`: board default for the path, then `git.defaultBaseBranch`,
   then `main`), after a throttled `fetchIfStale` of that branch. When the tree is on another
   branch, no branch was picked, and there are uncommitted TRACKED changes, it stays put and the
   response carries a `checkoutError` the renderer toasts ("Staying on ..."); nothing else runs.
   Otherwise the handler checks out the target if needed, then fast-forwards it onto
   `origin/<target>` (`--ff-only`, failure ignored) whenever the fetch produced a remote start
   point. A checkout failure falls back to the current branch with a `checkoutError`. This runs
   on a cold spawn only; a reattach never fetches or checks out
2. Create a session directory at `.kangentic/sessions/<transientTaskId>/` for bridge files
3. `await adapter.ensureTrust(projectRoot)` - trust pre-population, `kangentic` MCP enablement,
   and for Claude the diff-panel write (see
   [Global Config Writes](agent-integration.md#global-config-writes-claudejson)). The Command
   Terminal bypasses the two spawn chokepoints, but not this: every path that builds an agent
   command applies the adapter's pre-spawn global-config state first
4. Build Claude CLI command via `CommandBuilder` (with MCP server if enabled)
5. Call `SessionManager.spawn()` with `transient: true`

### Kill Flow (`SESSION_KILL_TRANSIENT`)

1. `kill()` the session (a young one gets its exit sequence and the 1500 ms grace), capture `awaitExit`, then `remove()` it from `SessionManager`; the handler returns at once, so the window closes immediately
2. Once the process has exited, delete the session directory from disk (best-effort cleanup). Deleting it under a still-exiting Claude made its SessionEnd hook write into a missing directory

Transient sessions are counted by the `session_spawn` analytics event with `isTransient: true`
(volume) and by `feature_used: command_terminal` (adoption); see [analytics.md](analytics.md).

## AbortSignal Pattern

When a task moves rapidly between columns (e.g. drag-and-drop corrections), spawns from earlier transitions can become stale before they complete. The transition engine uses `AbortSignal` to cancel in-flight spawns:

1. Each task move creates an `AbortController` for the transition
2. If the same task moves again before the previous transition completes, the old controller is aborted
3. The `AbortSignal` is threaded through `executeTransition()`, `executeAction()`, and `executeSpawnAgent()`
4. At each async boundary (CLI detection, worktree creation, PTY spawn), the signal is checked via `signal?.throwIfAborted()`
5. If aborted, the spawn stops immediately - no PTY process is created

The `isAbortError()` utility in `src/shared/abort-utils.ts` provides a type guard for distinguishing abort errors from real errors in catch blocks.

The board-driven spawn chokepoint `autoSpawnForTask` (`src/main/ipc/helpers/agent-spawn.ts`: the MCP create, the auto-spawn reconcile, and the phone's `start-session` verb) is cancellable the same way. It registers an `AbortController` on the per-task registry `SESSION_RESUME` uses (`handlers/session-resume-controllers.ts`), so `SESSION_SUSPEND`, `SESSION_RESET`, a newer `SESSION_RESUME`, and a project relocation cancel its in-flight git phase through `abortInFlightResume`, and the signal reaches `ensureTaskWorktree`, `ensureTaskBranchCheckout`, and `spawnAgent`. It registers WITHOUT aborting an existing controller first, unlike `SESSION_RESUME`: a phone Start never cancels desktop work, and two starts converge on one session through the gates below. The registry holds every in-flight controller per task (a `Set`, not one slot), so that second registration does not displace the desktop resume's controller: the next Pause reaches both. `tests/unit/session-resume-controllers.test.ts` pins that. Its lock is split the way `SESSION_RESUME`'s is: Phase 1 runs the gates (column re-check, live-session check, profile fold, `auto_spawn`, role) under `withTaskLock`, Phase 2 releases it for the worktree ensure and branch checkout (serialized per project by `WorktreeManager.projectQueues`), and Phase 3 re-acquires it, re-runs the same gates as the compare-and-swap, and spawns. Holding the lock across the fetch used to make a desktop Pause or move on the same task wait behind a phone Start. An abort is logged and swallowed, never counted as a spawn failure, and cleans up no session state: the engine's last abort checkpoint precedes the PTY spawn, and the `session_id` write follows it with no further checkpoint, so an abort never leaves a half-written session for the aborter to trip over.

## Terminal Paste Strategy

Terminal paste operations use xterm.js's built-in `terminal.paste()` method, which brackets the text (`ESC[200~ ... ESC[201~`) exactly when the foreground app enabled mode 2004 and leaves it plain otherwise. The paste path is unified:

- **Ctrl+V / Cmd+V** - intercepted by a custom key handler, reads clipboard, calls `terminal.paste()`
- **Ctrl+V with a clipboard image** - the image is saved to a temp PNG by the main process (`clipboard:readImage`) and its shell-quoted path goes through the same `terminal.paste()`; what is pasted (the bare path, or the adapter's fallback template) comes from the agent's `PastedImageCapability` (`resolveImagePasteText` in `terminal-clipboard.ts`)
- **File drop** - `useTerminalFileDrop` delivers every dropped path through `useTerminal`'s `paste` handle, one `terminal.paste()` per file so each path is its own packet under bracketed-paste mode; never a raw `sessions.write`. An image in a format the agent cannot attach from a path (`needsImageNormalization`) is first re-encoded as PNG in the renderer (`encodeImageFileAsPng`, Chromium's decoder) and saved by main through `clipboard:saveImage`, and the copy's path is what gets pasted
- **Context menu paste** - follows the same clipboard-read-then-paste path
- **Built-in xterm paste suppressed** - a `paste` event listener on the xterm helper textarea prevents the browser's native paste from double-sending text through xterm's `onData` handler

The bracketing is load-bearing for images: Claude Code scans a paste packet for tokens ending in png/jpg/jpeg/gif/webp and attaches the file as an `[Image #N]` chip in the user turn, so a pasted or dropped image reaches the model with no `Read` tool call. Typed bytes never reach that scan, which is why the image paths do not use a raw write. Main's write queue (`src/main/pty/write-queue.ts`) keeps a packet whole across chunk boundaries, and the PTY buffer manager re-asserts mode 2004 on replay, so a reattached session brackets the next paste correctly.

## Terminal Copy Strategy

Terminal copy operations write to the OS clipboard through the main process
(`clipboard:writeText`), which is synchronous and focus- and permission-independent.
`navigator.clipboard.writeText()` is deliberately not used: it rejects with `NotAllowedError`
when the document lacks focus, which is exactly the state during a native context-menu click and
when a TUI app emits its copy sequence. The copy paths are:

- **Ctrl+C with a selection / Ctrl+Shift+C** - the custom key handler reads the xterm selection,
  cleans soft-wraps, and writes it via the IPC.
- **Context menu Copy** - the native menu dispatches a `terminal-copy` event; the handler writes
  the selection via the same IPC.
- **OSC 52** - a TUI app (e.g. Claude Code's copy-on-select) copies by emitting
  `ESC]52;c;<base64>BEL`. A write-only OSC 52 handler decodes the payload and writes it via the
  IPC. Read requests (`Pd` is `?`) are ignored so a TUI can never read the user's clipboard back
  out of the terminal.
- **Scrollback replay** - recorded scrollback may contain OSC 52 sequences from an earlier copy;
  the replay path strips them so restoring a session (dialog reopen, resize, respawn) never
  clobbers the user's current clipboard.

### Terminal hyperlinks (OSC 8)

A TUI app can emit `ESC]8;;<url>ESC\` to mark text as a clickable hyperlink. Like OSC 52, these
are agent-controlled bytes with no user intent behind them - anything a session prints, `cat`s, or
echoes can carry one - so activation is gated rather than handed to the OS directly. `useTerminal`
installs a `linkHandler` (`src/renderer/utils/terminal-link-handler.ts`) that checks the URL
against `TERMINAL_LINK_SCHEMES` (`http:` / `https:` only, no `mailto:`) from
`src/shared/external-url.ts` and routes an allowed URL to the OS default browser via
`shell:openExternal`; anything else is dropped with a warning. Supplying this handler also replaces
xterm's built-in fallback, which would otherwise show a native `confirm()` dialog and then open the
URL in a bare, chrome-less `window.open()` window. The handler deliberately leaves
`allowNonHttpProtocols` unset so xterm's own http(s)-only filter stays live as an independent
second check; `tests/unit/terminal-link-handler.test.ts` statically scans `src/renderer` to keep it
that way.
