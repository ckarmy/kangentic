# Agent Integration

Kangentic supports fifteen AI coding agents: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Qwen Code, Cursor CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, OpenCode, Aider, Oz CLI (Warp), Kimi Code, Droid, Ollama, Grok Build, and Goose CLI. Each agent is wrapped behind a common `AgentAdapter` interface that handles CLI detection, command building, permission mapping, session lifecycle hooks, and cross-agent handoff. This doc covers the adapter system, agent-specific details, and shared infrastructure.

## Agent Adapter Interface

`src/main/agent/agent-adapter.ts`

Every agent implements the `AgentAdapter` interface. Each adapter lives in `src/main/agent/adapters/<name>/`. TUI agents also have a `transcript-cleanup.ts` file for handoff transcript processing (see [Handoff - Per-Agent Transcript Cleanup](handoff.md#per-agent-transcript-cleanup)).

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `detect(overridePath?)` | Locate the CLI binary and return path + version |
| `invalidateDetectionCache()` | Reset cached detection (e.g. after user changes CLI path) |
| `ensureTrust(workingDirectory)` | Pre-approve a directory so the agent doesn't prompt for trust, plus any other pre-spawn global-config state the adapter needs (see [Global Config Writes](#global-config-writes-claudejson)) |
| `probeAuth?()` | Optional. Check whether the agent is authenticated. Returns `true` (logged in), `false` (installed but not authenticated), or `null` (probe unavailable / I/O error). Only called by IPC after `detect()` reports `found: true`. Must never throw. Currently implemented by Kimi (see [Kimi Code -> Authentication](#authentication)) and Grok (`grok models`, whose output says "not authenticated" from local state). |
| `buildCommand(options)` | Build the shell command string to spawn the agent. `options.agentPath` is what `detect()` returned, except that on Windows a `.cmd` / `.bat` head is swapped by the spawn chokepoint for the sibling shim the PTY shell can run before the builder sees it (`resolveShimLaunch`, see [cross-platform.md](cross-platform.md#npm-cmd-shims-under-powershell-and-git-bash)); builders never inspect the extension |
| `interpolateTemplate(template, variables)` | Replace `{{key}}` placeholders in prompt templates |
| `runtime` | `AdapterRuntimeStrategy` declaring activity detection + session ID capture (see below) |
| `removeHooks(directory, taskId?)` | Remove the per-directory config an adapter injected, on cleanup. `taskId` lets shared-file adapters (Codex, Gemini, Droid) reference-count so concurrent sessions in the same cwd do not clobber each other. The payload is not only hooks: Gemini also strips its `mcpServers.kangentic` entry (which carries the per-launch token), and Droid's refcount guards `<cwd>/.factory/mcp.json` rather than a hooks file. |
| `clearSettingsCache()` | Clear cached merged settings |
| `detectFirstOutput(data)` | Detect the adapter's readiness escape, which lifts the shimmer overlay. A heuristic, not proof the agent is up - see First-Output Detection below |
| `getExitSequence()` | Return PTY write sequence for graceful exit |
| `locateSessionHistoryFile(agentSessionId, cwd)` | Locate the agent's native session history file on disk |

### Required Properties

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `name` | `string` | Unique identifier (`'claude'`, `'codex'`, `'gemini'`, `'qwen'`, `'cursor'`, `'copilot'`, `'opencode'`, `'aider'`, `'warp'`, `'kimi'`, `'droid'`, `'ollama'`, `'grok'`, `'antigravity'`, `'goose'`) |
| `displayName` | `string` | Human-readable product name |
| `sessionType` | `SessionRecord['session_type']` | Value stored in the sessions DB table |
| `supportsCallerSessionId` | `boolean` | True when the CLI accepts a caller-supplied session ID via `--session-id` (Claude). When false, Kangentic captures the agent's own ID via `runtime.sessionId` for `--resume`. |
| `permissions` | `AgentPermissionEntry[]` | Supported permission modes with agent-specific labels |
| `defaultPermission` | `PermissionMode` | Recommended default permission mode |
| `runtime` | `AdapterRuntimeStrategy` | Activity detection + session ID capture (see below) |

### Optional Properties

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `getSubmissionVerifier?(contextType)` | `(SubmissionContextType) => SubmissionVerifier \| null` | Returns a context-specific verification callback used in two flows: `'paste'` (post-`\r` confirmation in `TerminalSubmit.submitContent`) and `'command-injection'` (per-command confirmation in `TerminalSubmit.submitKeystrokes`, scheduled by `TerminalSubmitScheduler.scheduleKeystrokes`). The callback receives a `SubmissionContext` and returns `Promise<boolean>`. Adapters return `null` for contexts they cannot verify; every adapter returns `null` for `'paste'` today, falling back to the activity + data-floor backstops. Nine return a `'command-injection'` verifier: Claude (JSONL slash-invocation matching) and Codex, both VERIFIED and allowed to escalate; plus Copilot, OpenCode (via a read-only SQL query rather than a file read), Qwen, Kimi, Aider, Grok, and Antigravity (brain-dir transcript USER_INPUT matching), all CONFIRM-ONLY - they confirm and drive retry-on-Enter but are barred from escalation via `canEscalateOnVerificationFailure`. A verifier must only be added for an agent whose history is MEASURED to flush on submit; see [command-injection.md](command-injection.md) and [Embedded Browser - Paste Engine](embedded-browser.md#paste-engine). |
| `liveTelemetryUnsupported?` | `AgentLiveTelemetryUnsupported` | Set when the agent CLI has no per-session telemetry channel (no status file, session history, or stream output integration is possible). Carries the renderer-facing label and tooltip so all agent-specific copy lives with the adapter. Currently used by Droid and Antigravity. |
| `reportsRateLimits?` | `boolean` | Set by adapters whose CLI streams account-wide rate-limit windows (plan-usage quotas). The renderer ContextBar shows its rate-limit pill for any session of such an agent, sourced from a shared global snapshot that is merged monotonically per window across sessions (within a fixed window used-percentage only rises, so a session carrying a stale cached report never regresses the displayed values, and a genuine window rollover is taken wholesale). A freshly spawned terminal shows the same limits as its siblings before it has emitted its own status line. Omit (falsy) for adapters with no rate-limit telemetry. Currently set only by Claude. |
| `pastedImageNativeExtensions?` | `readonly string[]` | Image extensions (lowercase, no dot) the CLI attaches natively when the file's path arrives as a bracketed paste. Kangentic saves a pasted-clipboard or dropped image to a file (reliable even where the CLI's own clipboard reader silently fails, e.g. Claude Code on Windows with Snipping Tool images - claude-code#26679) and delivers the shell-quoted path through xterm's `terminal.paste()`, the way a native terminal delivers a drop; a CLI that scans a paste packet for image paths then attaches the file inline in the user turn with no `Read` tool call. A plain string array, never a RegExp: the value crosses IPC in `AgentDetectionInfo`. Omit when the CLI attaches nothing from a pasted path. An image outside the set is re-encoded as PNG by the renderer and saved through `clipboard:saveImage` when the set includes `png`, so the set only needs to name what was verified to attach. Set by Claude (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, its own `/\.(png\|jpe?g\|gif\|webp)$/i`, verified on 2.1.276), Gemini (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, verified on 0.60.0; a path with a space becomes an `@"..."` file reference instead of a chip), and OpenCode (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, verified on 1.18.30). Neither of those two was probed with webp, so a webp drop under them takes the PNG normalization, which attaches all the same. Probed negative on 2026-09-18, both quoted and bare, so left unset: Cursor 2026.09.10, Grok 1.0.0, Antigravity 1.1.13 (each inserts the path as text; Grok and Antigravity then open it with their own Read tool at submit). Not probed, since they could not reach a prompt on the probe machine: Codex (not signed in), Copilot 1.0.83 (the spawn fails with "No session, task, or name matched" for the session id the adapter passes), Qwen (not authenticated), Kimi (not logged in), Droid (not logged in), plus the uninstalled Aider, Oz, Ollama and Goose. The probe: spawn a session in a `/preview`, then `kangentic_devtools_pty_input` with `bytes` = base64 of `\x1b[200~"<absolute png path>"\x1b[201~`, and look for the chip; no submit is needed. |
| `pastedImageReferenceTemplate?` | `string` | Fallback text pasted for an image outside `pastedImageNativeExtensions` that could not be re-encoded as PNG (the bytes did not decode, or the set has no `png`), or for every image when that set is not declared (a typed path is inert text to most CLIs), so the agent reads an explicit instruction instead of a bare path. `{path}` is replaced with the shell-quoted absolute path; a template lacking `{path}` has the quoted path appended. Omit to paste the bare quoted path. Currently set only by Claude (`Read this image: {path} `, which now covers svg and any file whose bytes Chromium cannot decode). |
| `buildEnv?(options)` | `(SpawnCommandOptions) => Record<string, string> \| null` | Adapter-specific environment variables to inject into the PTY spawn. Two uses. Most implementers deliver MCP config an adapter cannot pass on the command line: either because the CLI has no MCP flag at all (OpenCode's `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, carrying the whole config), or because the value is a secret that must not land in argv or in a repo file (Codex and Droid both pass only `KANGENTIC_MCP_TOKEN`, referenced by name from their config). Grok extends the pattern furthest: its env carries the MCP URL and token (`KANGENTIC_MCP_URL` / `KANGENTIC_MCP_TOKEN`, dereferenced by grok's `${VAR}` expansion so its `.grok/config.toml` block stays fully static) plus `KANGENTIC_EVENTS_PATH` for the hook bridge's `env:` sentinel. Goose is the one non-MCP implementer: its native permission/autonomy control is an env var (`GOOSE_MODE`) rather than a flag, so the permission mode is delivered here. Implemented by OpenCode, Codex, Droid, Grok, and Goose. |
| `getExitSequence?()` | `() => string[]` | Sequence of strings to write to the PTY for a graceful exit. Default is `['\x03']` (Ctrl+C only). Claude overrides with `['\x03', '/exit\r']` to flush conversation state. |
| `attachSession?(context)` | `(SessionContext) => SessionAttachment \| void` | Per-session lifecycle hook for adapters that need work outside the declarative `runtime` strategy (out-of-band CLI queries, file watchers, etc.). The returned `dispose` is called on session end. |
| `summarize?(prompt, cliPath, cwd)` | `(string, string, string) => Promise<string>` | One-shot summarization for the auto-name-tasks-from-prompt feature. Spawns the CLI in non-interactive `--print` mode. Antigravity is the one PTY exception: `agy -p` hangs when stdio is not a TTY (upstream google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#318), so its summarize runs the print mode through a hidden PTY in a pre-trusted scratch cwd. Adapters without a clean headless mode (Aider, Warp) omit this, as do Ollama and Goose (neither's headless mode is wired yet). |
| `parseTranscript?(agentSessionId, cwd)` | `(string, string) => Promise<ParsedTranscript>` | Parse the agent's native session history into agent-agnostic `TranscriptEntry[]` for the MCP `get_transcript` structured format. The adapter owns all format/location knowledge (JSONL file, chat JSONL, SQLite DB), so `handleGetTranscript` never branches on agent name. Reads at most the most recent `MAX_PARSE_SOURCE_BYTES` (16MB) of the source, prepending a `truncated` system entry when it omits anything (see `parseTranscriptWindow` below for the unbounded walk). Must not throw; returns `{ entries: [], sourcePath }` on missing/corrupt history. Implemented by Claude, Droid, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, OpenCode, Grok, and Antigravity; Aider/Warp/Cursor/Copilot/Ollama/Goose omit it (raw format only). See [MCP server - get_transcript](mcp-server.md#kangentic_get_transcript). |
| `parseTranscriptWindow?(agentSessionId, cwd, startByte, maxBytes, attributedMessageIds?)` | `(string, string, number, number, Set<string>?) => Promise<ParsedTranscriptWindow>` | Parse ONE bounded byte window of the native transcript, retaining nothing between calls. `parseTranscript` returns only the most recent `MAX_PARSE_SOURCE_BYTES` of a large transcript (a whole-file read is what OOM'd the main process), which is right for a reader but would silently shrink the conversation INDEX to recent history only. The conversation indexer therefore walks with this instead: window by window from offset 0, chunking each window and dropping its entries, so the whole file is indexed while only one window is resident. Pass `nextByteOffset` back verbatim as the next `startByte`; the walk ends when it stops advancing or reaches `totalBytes`. `attributedMessageIds` is the walker's bounded usage-attribution carry, threaded through every window of one file: an agent that reports one API message's tokens on several transcript lines attributes them to the first line it emits, and a per-window dedupe attributes them AGAIN past a seam - invisible to chunking, but a double-counted turn in `conversation_turn_usage`, which keys a row per line uuid. Seed the dedupe from it, add what you attribute, prune it to a small bound before returning, and never reset it per window (a window can legitimately attribute nothing and still sit mid-message). Adapters whose usage is already one-per-line can ignore it. Implementations must NOT cache per-file state (a sweep touches every session, and retaining would evict the live viewer's hot parse state); the carry does not bend that, since it is the caller's and is not retained between calls. Implemented by Claude; adapters without it fall back to `parseTranscript` and index recent history only. |
| `statSubagentTranscripts?(agentSessionId, cwd)` | `(string, string) => SubagentTranscriptSignature \| null` | Cheap staleness signature (`fileCount`, `totalSize`, `maxMtimeMs`) for a session's subagent transcripts, computed without parsing them. Separate from the main transcript's signature on purpose: a subagent writes to its OWN file, so the main transcript's mtime and size never move while a fan-out runs, and an indexer watching only the main signature would never see the subagent turns. Returns `null` when the agent keeps no subagent transcripts for the session (pruned, or it never fanned out). Implemented by Claude (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<agentSessionId>/subagents/`); paired with `parseSubagentUsage` below. |
| `parseSubagentUsage?(agentSessionId, cwd)` | `(string, string) => Promise<ParsedSubagentUsage>` | Parse a session's Task-tool subagent turns into agent-agnostic `SubagentUsageTurn[]` for the durable turn-usage ledger (`conversation_turn_usage`). The adapter owns all format and location knowledge, including how one API message's repeated records fold into a single turn. That fold is NOT shareable with the main-transcript parser: Claude's subagent files re-emit a message mid-stream, so the main path's first-record-wins rule undercounts subagent output by 30% while staying exactly right for the main thread, which is why this folds field-wise max per `message.id` instead. `directoryPresent: false` records a coverage gap (no subagent transcripts for this session) rather than a quiet period; `complete: false` marks a partial read, so the caller retries later instead of marking the session indexed. Also returns `spawnLinks`: the spawning calls made BY these subagents, which is what lets a nested subagent resolve to the subagent that spawned it rather than only to a depth number. Those links are collected independently of the usage fold, because a message the ledger skips (no `usage`, or all-zero counts) can still carry the `Task` call that created a child, and a link dropped there is dropped identically on every re-walk. Must not throw. Implemented by Claude (`src/main/agent/adapters/claude/subagent-usage-parser.ts`); adapters with no subagent concept omit it and the ledger carries main-thread rows only, as it always has. |
| `subagentSpawnToolName?` | `string` | The name this agent's subagent-spawning tool carries in a transcript's `tool_use` blocks (Claude: `Task`). Read by the conversation indexer to record `turn_spawn_links` rows, which are the other half of `parent_tool_use_id`: that column names a tool call, and nothing otherwise recorded which turn emitted it. Declared here rather than matched inside `src/main/retrieval/` because the tool name is agent knowledge (see [[agent-adapters-boundary]]); a generic reader hardcoding `Task` would need surgery to admit the next agent, whereas this needs only the string. Filtering on it is also what keeps the link table small - a session emits thousands of tool-use ids and only the spawning ones are ever referenced. An adapter that omits it records no links, which costs nothing and is correct for an agent with no subagent concept. |
| `onProjectRelocated?(oldPath, newPath)` | `(string, string) => Promise<void>` | Migrate per-cwd data the agent keeps OUTSIDE the working directory, keyed by the absolute path, when that path changes. Invoked for two relocations with the same (oldPath, newPath) contract: a whole-project move (the `project:relocate` IPC handler, reached via Locate Folder / Change or the one-step "Move..." flow), and a single worktree-cwd rename on the first resume after a task's worktree was recreated at a new path (`migrateResumeCwdIfRenamed` in `src/main/transition-engine/resume-cwd-migration.ts`, which passes one worktree's old/new path so only that cwd's data moves). Called best-effort after the stored paths are settled and the new location exists. Implemented by Claude, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, Copilot, OpenCode, Kimi, Droid, Grok, and Antigravity (per-agent details in [Project relocation](#project-relocation) below); the shared mechanics (path-pair collection, directory rename/merge, backup + atomic write, serial lock) live in `src/main/agent/shared/relocation-utils.ts`. Implementations must be non-destructive and never block the caller. Aider, Cursor, Warp, and Ollama omit this (their resumable state is in-project or absent). Goose omits it for a different reason: its resumable state is real and global, keyed by the caller-supplied `--name` rather than by path, so a relocation leaves nothing to migrate (see [Project relocation](#project-relocation)). |
| `onWorktreeRemoved?(worktreePath)` | `(string) => Promise<void>` | Drop per-directory state the adapter recorded in a GLOBAL config file for a worktree Kangentic has just deleted. Kangentic creates a worktree per task, so an adapter keyed by absolute path accumulates one dead entry per task forever with nothing to clean it up (one machine reached 473). Dispatched from the single chokepoint inside `WorktreeManager.removeWorktree`, via a listener the main process registers at startup (`setWorktreeRemovedListener` -> `notifyAdaptersWorktreeRemoved`), so the git module never imports the agent registry and no removal path can run un-notified. Generic over `agentRegistry.list()` - no agent-name branching. Best-effort and never fatal: the worktree is already gone. Implemented by Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml` directory trust), Gemini (`~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json`), Grok (`~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml`), and Antigravity (`trustedWorkspaces` in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`), the four adapters that key trust by absolute path in a global file. All remove only an entry they could have written themselves, never a user decision. Every other adapter's per-directory state lives inside the worktree and disappears with it. |
| `probeAuth?()` | `() => Promise<boolean \| null>` | See the methods table above. |
| `remoteExecution?` | `{ info: AgentRemoteExecutionInfo; probeServer(server): Promise<RemoteServerStatus> }` | Declared by adapters whose CLI can attach to an already-running server the user operates, instead of always spawning a local process (e.g. OpenCode's `opencode attach <url> --dir <serverPath>`). `info` (`urlPlaceholder`, `authKind`, `workingDirectoryScope`, `remoteModeCaveat?`) is surfaced to the renderer via `AgentDetectionInfo.remoteExecution` so the Agent settings tab renders remote-mode rows (right after the CLI Path row) only for capability-declaring agents - no agent-name branching, including for the adapter-authored caveat text. `probeServer` replaces `probeAuth` as the reachability check when a project's mode for this agent is `remote`: it must hit the server directly and never throw. Implemented today only by OpenCode. See [configuration.md - Remote Execution](configuration.md#remote-execution). |
| `launchOptions?` | `readonly AgentLaunchOptionInfo[]` | Declared by adapters whose CLI exposes optional boolean startup toggles (id, label, description, default). Surfaced to the renderer via `AgentDetectionInfo.launchOptions` so the Agent settings tab renders one toggle row per declared option, only for capability-declaring agents. Values are resolved by `resolveLaunchOptions` (`src/main/agent/shared/launch-options.ts`) from `agent.launchOptions[agentName]` (falling back to each option's `default`) and threaded through as `CommandOptions.launchOptions`; only the adapter's own command builder interprets an `id` into a concrete CLI flag - no agent-name branching outside the adapter. Implemented today only by Codex, which declares `disableApps` (maps to `--disable apps`, skipping the optional cloud ChatGPT Apps MCP connector that can hang startup at "Booting MCP server: codex_apps" - openai/codex#20167). See [configuration.md - agent.*](configuration.md#agent) for the config shape. |
| `discoverCapabilities?(cliPath, forceRefresh?)` | `(string, boolean?) => Promise<AgentCapabilities>` | Probe the live CLI for adapter-specific knobs (e.g. parsing `--help` for valid effort levels and the presence of a `--model` flag). Result is attached to `AgentDetectionInfo.capabilities` and read by the renderer to gate optional UI controls (Model and Effort dropdowns on `EditColumnDialog`). `forceRefresh` (set when a model dropdown opens) bypasses any adapter-internal capability caches - notably Claude's 12h `/model` picker probe - so a newly shipped model surfaces without a restart; adapters with no cache to bypass ignore it. Implementations must never throw - return an empty object on parse failure so the rest of detection still succeeds. |
| `getInjectionSequence?(spec)` | `(SettingsChangeSpec) => string[]` | Translate a column-level settings change (model / effort) into the writes the `TerminalSubmitScheduler` should push onto the live PTY. Sibling of `getExitSequence` - both return `string[]` of writes. Claude returns `['/model X', '/effort Y']` for changed fields. Adapters with no live-swap slash return `[]` and the caller falls back to suspend+respawn. |
| `canVerifySlashSubmission?()` | `() => boolean` | Whether a SLASH-prefixed `auto_command` can be verified in this agent's history. Omitted or `true` means yes. Declaring `false` makes `prepareInjectionPlan` tag that command `verify: 'none'`, so it is neither retried nor escalated and the outcome stays `unconfirmed`. Exists because absence from the history file is AMBIGUOUS for agents that handle slash input in the TUI - it cannot distinguish "the CLI rejected it" from "the CLI ran it client-side" - and treating the second as a failure escalates a command that actually worked into a session restart. Declared `false` by Codex, which prints "Unrecognized command" and writes no record; by OpenCode, which declines slash commands the same way; by Grok, whose slash input runs in the TUI palette and never becomes a chat_history turn; and by Antigravity, which rejects an unregistered `/command` client-side ("Unknown command") without recording it. See [command-injection.md](command-injection.md). |
| `canEscalateOnVerificationFailure?()` | `() => boolean` | Whether a verification FAILURE may escalate to a restart-with-prompt. Omitted or `true` means yes. Declaring `false` marks the verifier CONFIRM-ONLY: it still confirms and still drives retry-on-Enter (rung 2, where nearly all the delivery win lives), but is barred from rung 3, because a false negative from an unproven verifier is a guess and escalation acts on that guess by destroying live work. Escalation takes TWO proofs: flush latency measured live (`scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs`), AND the adapter's own verifier watched confirming a real submission inside a running app. The second is separate because the harness reads the history with its OWN file reader, so it cannot catch a resolver pointing at the wrong path, an uncaptured session id, or a CLI that wraps the stored text - each a PERMANENT false negative that would escalate every delivery. Declared `false` today by Copilot, OpenCode, Qwen, Kimi, Aider, Grok, and Antigravity; only Claude and Codex escalate. Graduation recipe: [command-injection.md](command-injection.md). |
| `describeStartupFailure?(finalOutput, exitCode)` | `(string, number) => string \| null` | Read a STARTUP failure out of the CLI's own final output. Called by the PTY exit listener when a task session ends on its own (never for a kill or a suspend, never for a Command Terminal), with the raw ring and the exit code. A sentence is surfaced through the same "Agent did not start" notice a failed worktree or checkout raises; `null` for a normal end or a crash the adapter cannot name. Claude implements it for `--resume <id>` of a conversation the CLI reports it cannot find ("No conversation found with session ID"); the other startup shapes probed on 2.1.276 either keep the TUI up (bad API key, invalid settings JSON, unknown model) or are not something Kangentic can produce, see the header of `tests/unit/claude-startup-failure.test.ts`. Add a recognizer only for wording seen on a real card. A notice after the fact, deliberately not a pre-spawn guard that downgrades the resume: that was built and reverted in #255 because a path Kangentic computes can be wrong while the conversation is fine. |
| `requiresAgentSessionIdForVerification?()` | `() => boolean` | Whether this adapter's verifier needs a captured `agent_session_id` to locate its history. Omitted or `true` means it does, which is the norm. Declared `false` by Aider and Copilot, for different reasons. Aider has NO session id at all (no `sessionIdCapture` in its `runtime`) because it keeps one `.aider.chat.history.md` per project directory, so `cwd` alone identifies its history. Copilot HAS a session id, but its prompt history is a single GLOBAL `~/.copilot/command-history-state.json` shared across every session and project, so neither the id nor `cwd` plays any part in locating it. Without the opt-out `buildCommandInjectionVerifier` short-circuits on the missing id and the verifier can never confirm - worse than having none, since the burst still retries and then reports `failed` instead of staying silently `unconfirmed`. |
| `transcriptUsage?(input)` | `({ transcriptPath?, agentSessionId?, cwd? }) => Promise<TranscriptUsage \| null>` | Parse CUMULATIVE lifetime token usage for a session from the agent's own transcript - the authoritative source for the per-task lifetime-stats rollup, since the live statusLine token counts are a current-context snapshot (Claude Code 2.1.132+). Prefers the explicit `transcriptPath`, else derives it from `agentSessionId` + `cwd`. Must not throw; returns `null` when the transcript is missing/unparseable so the caller falls back to the snapshot. Implemented by Claude and Grok (Grok reads the last cumulative `turn_completed.usage` from `updates.jsonl`). |
| `transcriptToolCounts?(input)` | `({ transcriptPath?, agentSessionId?, cwd? }) => Promise<TranscriptToolCounts \| null>` | Sibling of `transcriptUsage`: parse a cumulative tool-call count + callCount-only per-tool breakdown from the agent's own transcript. Backfills the live `UsageAccumulator` count for sessions whose ToolStart/ToolEnd hook events never reached it (e.g. a parked/suspended session that reports 0 despite real cost/tokens). Counts DISTINCT `tool_use` ids (parallel tool calls in one message count separately; a streamed re-emission of the same message does not double-count). Same location contract as `transcriptUsage`; must not throw, returns `null` on a missing/tool-less transcript so the caller keeps the live count. Implemented by Claude, Grok (counting distinct `tool_call` ids in `updates.jsonl`), and Antigravity. |
| `configuredModelFromCommand?(command)` | `(string) => { id: string; displayName: string } \| null` | Extract the configured model from a spawned command so the board card can show a friendly model name IMMEDIATELY, before the agent reports its own via status.json / stream telemetry. Returns `{ id, displayName }` (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8` -> "Opus 4.8"), or `null` when the command encodes no explicit model. The seeded value is a placeholder: the agent's own live telemetry overrides it once reported (full usage replace), so a later in-session `/model` change stays accurate. Each adapter owns its own command syntax and model-naming scheme. Implemented by Claude (`adapters/claude/model-display-name.ts`), Grok (`--model` extraction with display names from `~/.grok/models_cache.json`), and Antigravity (`antigravityModelDisplayName`), where the seeded value matters most because Antigravity has no live telemetry to override it. |

### `AgentCapabilities`

`src/shared/types.ts`

Adapter-discovered capabilities surfaced to the renderer (returned by `discoverCapabilities`). All fields are optional - adapters that cannot discover a capability leave it undefined and the corresponding UI control is not rendered. Nothing is hardcoded in Kangentic; values come from the live CLI.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `effortLevels?` | `string[]` | Effort/reasoning levels accepted by the CLI's `--effort` (or equivalent) flag. Claude parses these from the `--help` output. Drives the Effort dropdown on `EditColumnDialog`. |
| `supportsModelOverride?` | `boolean` | True when the CLI accepts a model override flag (e.g. Claude `--model <alias>`). When true and `models` has entries, the renderer shows a dropdown; when true and `models` is empty/undefined, the renderer falls back to a free-form text input. |
| `models?` | `string[]` | Model identifiers the user can pick from. Discovered from agent-specific sources: Claude scans `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<sessionId>.jsonl` for assistant `message.model` values, and merges ids harvested from the CLI's own `/model` picker driven through a hidden short-lived PTY (`model-picker-probe.ts`). The picker probe runs in the background and its result is read from a cache, so discovery never blocks on it; a newly shipped model surfaces on the next discovery after the probe settles, with silent fallback to the transcript scan on any failure. Absent when no curated list is available - the renderer falls back to a free-form text input. |
| `modelDisplayNames?` | `Record<string, string>` | Friendly display name per entry in `models` (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8` -> "Opus 4.8"), computed by the adapter (Claude via `humanizeClaudeModelId`) so no agent-naming knowledge lives in shared or renderer code. Drives the humanized rows in the Model dropdown (`ModelCombobox`) and the ContextBar model popover; an id absent from the map falls back to showing its raw id. |

`AgentDetectionInfo.capabilities?: AgentCapabilities` - populated at detection time; absent for adapters that do not implement `discoverCapabilities`.

### Per-Adapter Capability Discovery

Beyond Claude (detailed above) and Ollama (which lists installed models via `ollama list`, see [Ollama](#ollama)), ten adapters each ship their own `src/main/agent/adapters/<name>/capability-discovery.ts`. Most of those that probe the CLI share a common shape built on the bounded session-history scan helpers in `src/main/agent/shared/history-scan.ts` (`listMostRecentDirs` / `listMostRecentFiles` / `readHeadBytes` / `readTailBytes` / `parseJsonlRecords`, all capped so discovery stays fast on a heavily-used install):

1. **Model-override flag** - run `<cli> --help` and regex for a `--model` / `-m` flag to set `supportsModelOverride`.
2. **Model list** - when that flag is present, scan the agent's own on-disk session history for the distinct model ids the user has actually used, sorted ascending so families cluster. An empty result leaves `models` undefined and the renderer falls back to a free-form text input.
3. **Effort levels** - Copilot and Antigravity parse these from `--help`, and Grok reads a real ladder (`low`..`xhigh`) from its models cache; every other non-Claude adapter reports `effortLevels: []` (no CLI effort concept).

All implementations are best-effort and never throw: a help-read or history-scan failure yields conservative defaults so the rest of detection still succeeds. **No adapter keeps a list of model names or ids.** Per `.claude/rules/cli-features-over-custom-layers.md`, a model list is either discovered (from the CLI or from the CLI's own cache) or derived from the id, and a discovery failure reports no list rather than a guess - the renderer then shows a free-form model input. Four adapters deviate from the history-scan probe shape: Droid discovers nothing and hardcodes `supportsModelOverride: false` by design; Grok discovers everything (models, display names, effort ladders) from `~/.grok/models_cache.json`, the CLI's own maintained cache, with a `--help` parse as its fresh-install fallback; Antigravity parses `--help` for flags and effort levels and fetches its model list from the CLI's own `agy models` listing; and Cursor does the same through `cursor-agent --list-models`.

| Adapter | `--model`? | Effort levels | Model list source | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Qwen Code | `--help` (`--model` / `-m`) | None | `~/.qwen/projects/<hash>/chats/*.jsonl` - assistant `model` + `ui_telemetry` `systemPayload.uiEvent.model` | Probes both shapes for schema-drift resilience. |
| Gemini | `--help` (`--model` / `-m`) | None | `~/.gemini/tmp/<basename(cwd)>/chats/session-*.{json,jsonl}` - top-level `model` + each `messages[].model` | Reads single-document `.json` in full; head-scans `.jsonl`. |
| Codex | `--help` (`--model` / `-m`) | None | `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-*.jsonl` - `turn_context` events' `payload.model` | Codex effort is `config.toml` `model_reasoning_effort` only (no CLI flag), so effort stays empty. |
| GitHub Copilot | `--help` (`--model <...>`) | `--help` `--reasoning-effort` / `--effort` line (commander.js `choices:` format, quotes stripped) | `~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/events.jsonl` (tail) - `session.shutdown` `data.currentModel` / `data.model` / `modelMetrics` keys | The only non-Claude adapter that discovers effort levels; scans the file tail because the model-bearing shutdown event lands last. |
| Kimi | `--help` (`--model` / `-m`) | None | `~/.kimi/sessions/<md5(workdir)>/<uuid>/wire.jsonl` - top-level `model` + `message.payload.model` | Best-effort; upstream CLI research was quota-limited, so the payload probe is deliberately broad. |
| Cursor | `--help` (`--model` only, no `-m`) | None | `cursor-agent --list-models` - `<id> - <Display Name>` lines (skipping the `Available models` header and the `Tip:` footer) | Ids, so a `--model` override round-trips; display names feed `modelDisplayNames`. The `(default)` / `(current)` state markers are stripped, `(NO ZDR)` is kept. The listing is a network fetch, so the result is cached per cliPath and `forceRefresh` bypasses it. Reasoning is encoded in the model id, not a separate flag. |
| OpenCode | `--help` best-effort, defaults false | None | (no history scan) | Model selection is intentionally left to the TUI / `opencode.json` per `cli-features-over-custom-layers.md`; no curated model list. |
| Antigravity | `--help` (`--model`) | `--help` `--effort` line (`low`/`medium`/`high`) | `agy models` subcommand - `slug<TAB>Display Name` lines (skipping the fetch banner) | The one adapter whose model list comes from a CLI subcommand rather than a history scan; `agy models` is a network fetch, so the result is cached per cliPath and `forceRefresh` bypasses it. Display names feed `modelDisplayNames` directly. |
| Droid | No (hardcoded false, no probe) | None | (no history scan) | Intentional: `discoverDroidCapabilities` ignores `cliPath` and returns `supportsModelOverride: false` so the Model / Effort dropdowns stay hidden. TUI-first per `cli-features-over-custom-layers.md`. |
| Grok Build | `~/.grok/models_cache.json` (fallback: `--help` `-m, --model`) | `models_cache.json` `reasoning_efforts[].id` per model (`low`..`xhigh`) | `~/.grok/models_cache.json` `models.<id>.info` (the CLI's own `/model` picker source; `hidden: true` entries skipped) | The cache carries ids, display names (`info.name`), context windows, AND effort ladders in one file grok itself maintains, so nothing is scraped from sessions. The discovery result is memoized per cliPath (mirroring Antigravity), so repointing `agent.cliPaths.grok` re-discovers instead of returning the previous binary's capabilities. |

### `CommandOptions` - new spawn knobs

`src/main/agent/agent-adapter.ts`

Four recently-added optional fields drive per-spawn overrides. Adapters consume them in `buildCommand` to emit the appropriate CLI flag (or branch) when the value is present:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `model?` | `string` | Adapter-specific model identifier (e.g. Claude `--model opus`). Empty/undefined leaves the agent default in place. Sourced from `swimlane.model_override` at spawn time by `prepare-spawn.ts`. |
| `effort?` | `string` | Adapter-specific effort/reasoning level (e.g. Claude `--effort xhigh`). Empty/undefined leaves the agent default in place. Sourced from `swimlane.effort_override` at spawn time by `prepare-spawn.ts`. |
| `executionTarget?` | `ResolvedExecutionTarget` | Present only when this project's execution mode for the agent is `remote` (see [Remote Execution](#remote-execution) below and [configuration.md - Remote Execution](configuration.md#remote-execution)). Adapters that declare `remoteExecution` read this instead of spawning the CLI locally; `undefined` unambiguously means local. Resolved by `resolveExecutionTarget()` and populated at both spawn chokepoints (`transition-engine.ts`, `session-startup/prepare-spawn.ts`). |
| `launchOptions?` | `Record<string, boolean>` | Fully-defaulted boolean launch-option values for this agent, keyed by `AgentLaunchOptionInfo.id` (e.g. Codex's `disableApps` -> `--disable apps`). `undefined` for adapters that declare no launch options. Resolved by `resolveLaunchOptions()` and populated at both spawn chokepoints (`transition-engine.ts`, `session-startup/prepare-spawn.ts`). |

For mid-session overrides (changing model/effort on a live session without respawn), see `getInjectionSequence` and `getSubmissionVerifier` in the Optional Properties table above. The adapter declares the slash-command writes; `TerminalSubmitScheduler.scheduleKeystrokes` delivers them via `TerminalSubmit.submitKeystrokes` with verification via `getSubmissionVerifier('command-injection')`.

### `AdapterRuntimeStrategy`

`src/shared/types.ts`

One scannable block per adapter for activity-state derivation and session ID capture:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `activity` | `ActivityDetectionStrategy` | How thinking-vs-idle is detected. See [Activity Detection](activity-detection.md) for the discriminated union variants and the `ActivityDetection.hooks() / pty() / hooksAndPty()` factories. |
| `sessionId.fromHook?(hookContext)` | `(string) => string \| null` | Parse the agent's CLI session ID from hook stdin JSON. Fires once on `session_start`. Used by Gemini (`session_id` field) and Codex (`thread_id` from the full SessionStart hookContext that event-bridge captures from the hook stdin). |
| `sessionId.fromOutput?(data)` | `(string) => string \| null` | Parse the agent's CLI session ID from raw PTY output. Scanned on every data chunk by `SessionIdScanner` (chunk-boundary-safe rolling buffer with ANSI stripping), plus a final scrollback scan in `suspend()`. Used for Codex's startup header and Gemini's shutdown summary. |
| `sessionId.fromFilesystem?(options)` | `({ spawnedAt, cwd }) => Promise<string \| null>` | Locate the agent's session ID by scanning the filesystem for a freshly-created session file. Polls the expected directory for files created after `spawnedAt` with a matching `cwd` in the session metadata. Primary capture path for Codex 0.118+ (neither PTY output nor hooks deliver the ID; the UUID is in the rollout filename at `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl`). |
| `sessionHistory?.locate({agentSessionId, cwd})` | `(options) => Promise<string \| null>` | Locate the agent's native session history file on disk for a captured session UUID. Used by `SessionHistoryReader` (`src/main/pty/readers/session-history-reader.ts`) to start tailing. See [Adapter Session History](adapter-session-history.md) for the full pipeline. |
| `sessionHistory?.parse(content, mode)` | `(string, 'full' \| 'append') => SessionHistoryParseResult` | Parse newly-appended bytes (Codex JSONL, Claude transcript JSONL) or full file content (Gemini JSON) into a `SessionHistoryParseResult` containing `usage`, `events[]`, and an optional `activity` hint. For Claude this is a background-session fallback to the `statusFile` pipeline - see [Adapter Session History](adapter-session-history.md#claude). |
| `sessionHistory?.isFullRewrite` | `boolean` | `true` for whole-file-rewrite agents (Gemini), `false` for append-only JSONL (Codex, Claude). Tells the watcher whether to track a byte cursor. |
| `statusFile?.parseStatus(raw)` | `(string) => SessionUsage \| null` | Decode the rewritten contents of a per-session `status.json` (written by Kangentic's status-bridge hook) into a `SessionUsage` snapshot. Used by Claude Code and Copilot. Adapters that report plan-usage quotas populate `SessionUsage.rateLimits?: RateLimitWindow[]` - each window self-describes via `id`, `label`, `iconKind: 'session' \| 'period'` (renderer maps to a Lucide icon), `usedPercentage` (0-100, clamp at the adapter), `resetsAt` (Unix epoch seconds), and optionally `windowDurationSeconds` (fixed window length; with `resetsAt` it yields the window start for the renderer's elapsed-time marker line, omitted when a provider's window has no fixed duration, in which case that window simply shows no time marker). The renderer iterates the array; no per-agent branching. Today only Claude populates this field. |
| `statusFile?.parseEvent(line)` | `(string) => SessionEvent \| null` | Decode one appended line from the per-session `events.jsonl` (written by the event-bridge hook) into a `SessionEvent`. |
| `statusFile?.isFullRewrite` | `boolean` | `true` when `status.json` is fully rewritten on every update. The events file is always append-only regardless of this flag. |
| `streamOutput?.createParser()` | `() => StreamOutputParser` | Build a per-session parser that consumes raw PTY stdout for telemetry. Used by agents that emit machine-readable NDJSON to the terminal (Cursor's `--output-format stream-json` init event carries `model` + `session_id`). The returned object exposes `parseTelemetry(data)` returning `{ usage?, events? } \| null`; `SessionManager` invokes it on every PTY chunk. Each spawn gets a fresh parser so per-session rolling buffers can survive across chunk boundaries. |
| `backgroundShells?.resolveOutputFile({cwd, shellId})` | `(options) => string \| null` | Locate the agent's on-disk output file for a NAMED background shell, or `null` when it has none. The bg-shell process-tree watcher stats this file each poll cycle; file growth is ground-truth liveness that keeps a genuinely-running shell from being reclaimed at the 5-min named cap when no OS PID could be captured (see [Activity Detection](activity-detection.md), Output-file liveness). Today only Claude implements this (its temp `tasks/<shellId>.output` files). |
| `backgroundShells?.reportTerminatedShells?({cwd, agentSessionId, shellIds})` | `(options) => string[]` | Report which of `shellIds` have a TERMINAL notification in the agent's durable session transcript - definitive proof of completion (task #386), independent of process-tree/output state. Reads only new transcript bytes since the previous call. Today only Claude implements this (its native transcript carries the holder's terminal `<task-notification>`; when the CLI is mid-turn it delivers that notification as a `queued_command` attachment which fires no hook, and mid-turn is exactly when a drain matters - see [Activity Detection](activity-detection.md), Transcript drain). Covers both backgrounded Bash shells and `Monitor` waits, which share the same id space, output store, and notification wrapper. |
| `permissionPrompts?.reportRejectedPromptTools?({cwd, agentSessionId, toolIds, sinceMs})` | `(options) => string[]` | Report which of `toolIds` were manually REJECTED, per a terminal marker in the agent's durable session transcript at or after `sinceMs` - the only signal for a denial no hook can report (task #640). `SessionTelemetry` polls this every 2s while any session is `permissionPending`. Today only Claude implements this (a denied tool never runs, so `PostToolUse` never fires, and the turn aborts rather than ending, so `Stop` never fires either; the durable transcript still records the denial as a `tool_result` - see [Activity Detection](activity-detection.md), Permission flag). |

Omit `sessionId` entirely for agents that use caller-owned IDs (Claude and Grok via `--session-id`) or that have no resume mechanism (Aider). Omit `sessionHistory` for agents without a native session log file. Omit `statusFile` for agents that don't emit hook-driven `status.json` / `events.jsonl` (Claude, Copilot, and Grok use this pipeline today; Grok's `parseStatus` is null because it has no statusline, but its hook-driven `parseEvent` is live). Omit `streamOutput` for agents that don't emit machine-readable NDJSON to PTY stdout (everyone except Cursor today). Omit `backgroundShells` for agents that don't write a per-shell output file or expose a transcript-based termination signal (everyone except Claude today). Omit `permissionPrompts` for agents whose hook protocol already reports a denial directly, or whose transcript carries no such signal (everyone except Claude today).

### `SpawnSessionInput` extras

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `agentName?` | `string` | Human-readable agent name (`'claude'`, `'gemini'`, etc.) captured at spawn time. Used in diagnostic logs - survives production minification unlike `agentParser.constructor.name`. |
| `agentSessionId?` | `string \| null` | Caller-owned agent session UUID. Set when the adapter declares `supportsCallerSessionId = true` and the spawn pipeline pre-generates a UUID before invoking the CLI (Claude `--session-id`, Qwen `--session-id`, Kimi `--session`, Grok `-s`). Lets `session-spawn-flow.ts` call `sessionHistoryReader.attach()` immediately at spawn time without waiting for capture pathways to round-trip, and skips the 30s "session ID not captured" diagnostic timer. Null/undefined for adapters that auto-generate IDs (Codex, Gemini, Droid). |

## Agent Resolution

`src/main/transition-engine/agent-resolver.ts`

When a task moves to a column, `resolveTargetAgent()` determines which agent to spawn:

1. **Task agent_override** (`task.agent_override`, set at task creation via the New Task dialog's Advanced section) - highest priority. When set, the agent is locked for the task's entire lifetime; column moves cannot change it.
2. **Column agent_override** (per-column setting)
3. **Project default_agent** (per-project setting)
4. **Global fallback** (`DEFAULT_AGENT` constant, currently `'claude'`)

`task.agent` is intentionally NOT in the resolution chain. It records which agent last ran on the task (for resume and handoff detection), but column and project settings are the authority for which agent should run. Including `task.agent` caused bugs where tasks that previously ran Claude would always resolve to Claude even when moved to a Codex column.

**Handoff detection:** When `task.agent` is set and differs from the resolved agent, a cross-agent handoff is triggered. See [Handoff](handoff.md) for the full context transfer flow.

## First-Output Detection

Each adapter implements `detectFirstOutput(data)` to spot the first output worth showing. This controls when the shimmer overlay lifts in the terminal UI.

| Agent | Detection Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | TUI hides cursor when it takes over the terminal |
| Codex CLI | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | Same TUI pattern as Claude |
| Gemini CLI | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | Same TUI pattern as Claude |
| Qwen Code | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | Same TUI pattern as Claude (inherited from gemini-cli fork) |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | Same TUI pattern as Claude |
| Cursor CLI | `data.length > 0` | Streams output immediately (no alternate screen buffer) |
| Aider | `data.length > 0` | Aider writes output immediately (no TUI alternate screen) |
| Oz CLI (Warp) | `data.length > 0` | `oz agent run` streams output, no alternate screen |
| Kimi Code | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | TUI hides cursor when its alternate-screen buffer takes over (verified empirically with kimi v1.37.0) |
| Droid | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | Ink-based TUI, same pattern as Claude (verified empirically) |
| OpenCode | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | Full-screen TUI initializes alternate screen buffer with cursor hide on first frame |
| Ollama | `data.length > 0` | Ollama streams output immediately (no alternate screen buffer) |
| Grok Build | `\x1b[?25l` (cursor hide) | Rust alt-screen TUI; the cursor-hide arrives in the very first output chunk, before the alt-screen switch (verified via node-pty against grok 1.0.0) |
| Antigravity CLI | `data.length > 0` | First paint (logo + welcome banner) arrives as one plain-text burst well under a second after spawn (verified against agy 1.1.13) |
| Goose CLI | `data.length > 0` | Streams output immediately (no alternate screen buffer) |

The `\x1b[?25l` (ANSI cursor hide) sequence usually fires after the shell prompt noise but before the TUI draws its startup banner, which keeps the shell command hidden behind the shimmer overlay.

**It is a shimmer heuristic, never proof the agent is running.** A shell can emit the same
escape during its own startup: pwsh 7.6's preamble carries `\x1b[?25l` (see
`buildSpawnClearPrelude` in `src/shared/paths.ts`), so on PowerShell the latch trips on SHELL
bytes tens of ms after spawn, seconds before the agent process exists. Anything needing "the
agent is demonstrably driving the terminal" must key on the stream's first alt-screen entry
instead (`PtyBufferManager`'s `onAltScreenEnter`) - misreading this latch as agent liveness is
what made the task #573 spawn-race fix miss its target on PowerShell. See
[session-lifecycle.md](session-lifecycle.md)'s "Post-boot geometry re-assert".

## Exit Sequences

Graceful exit sequences written to the PTY before a force-kill. `SessionManager.suspend()` writes one for every session; `kill()` writes one for a young session (inside the agent's boot window, see the `kill()` grace in [session-lifecycle.md](session-lifecycle.md)); the quit path's `killAll()` writes one best-effort for every session.

| Agent | Sequence | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Claude Code | `Ctrl+C`, `/exit` | Flushes conversation state to JSONL transcript |
| Codex CLI | `Ctrl+C` | API-backed sessions, no local state to flush |
| Gemini CLI | `Ctrl+C`, `/quit` | Triggers clean shutdown |
| Qwen Code | `Ctrl+C`, `/quit` | Same TUI shutdown as Gemini (fork) |
| Cursor CLI | `Ctrl+C` | No graceful exit needed |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `Ctrl+C`, `/exit` | Same TUI exit pattern as Claude |
| Aider | `Ctrl+C`, `/exit` | `/exit` lets Aider flush `.aider.chat.history.md` before termination |
| Oz CLI (Warp) | `Ctrl+C` | No session resume mechanism |
| Kimi Code | `Ctrl+C`, `/exit` | Conventional TUI quit; flushes context.jsonl / wire.jsonl |
| Droid | `Ctrl+C`, `/quit` | Triggers clean shutdown of the Ink TUI |
| OpenCode | `Ctrl+C` | Verified 2026-04-28: PTY exits in ~1s. `/exit` and `/quit` are not recognized slash commands. |
| Ollama | `Ctrl+C`, `/bye` | `/bye` exits the interactive REPL; harmless after a one-shot run has already exited |
| Grok Build | `Ctrl+C`, `/quit` | `/quit` exits cleanly (probe-verified exit 0) and prints the conversation dump that transcript cleanup anchors on |
| Antigravity CLI | `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+C` | First Ctrl+C prints "press ctrl+c again to exit" (or cancels a running turn); the second exits gracefully, printing the `agy --conversation=<uuid>` resume summary (the fromOutput capture source) and flushing `cache/last_conversations.json`. No `/quit` slash command exists |
| Goose CLI | `Ctrl+C`, `/exit` | Goose's Ctrl+C is contextual: it clears the line if text is entered, interrupts the request if one is processing, and exits only when the line is already empty. A kill usually lands mid-turn, where Ctrl+C alone only interrupts, so the explicit `/exit` is what ends the session before the teardown grace expires |

## Session History File Location

During cross-agent handoff, each adapter's `locateSessionHistoryFile()` finds the source agent's native session file:

| Agent | File Pattern | Method |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<sessionId>.jsonl` | Direct path computation |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl` | Directory scan with polling |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/tmp/<projectDir>/chats/session-<id>.json` **or** `.jsonl` | Directory scan with polling. Both extensions are live (Gemini cut over on 2026-04-28); an anchored `\.json$` matches nothing on a current install |
| Qwen Code | `~/.qwen/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/chats/<sessionId>.jsonl` | Direct path construction (the session id is caller-owned via `--session-id`). Despite being a gemini-cli fork, Qwen does NOT inherit Gemini's `tmp/<basename>/chats/session-<timestamp><shortId>.json` scheme |
| Cursor CLI | N/A | Returns null - the location IS known (`~/.cursor/projects/<cwd-slug>/agent-transcripts/<id>/<id>.jsonl`, see [Command Injection](command-injection.md#cursor-located-not-yet-verified)) but is not wired in: the records carry no timestamp and the stored text is wrapped |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | N/A | Returns null (not yet empirically verified; activity flows through hooks JSONL) |
| Aider | N/A | Returns null (no native session files) |
| Oz CLI (Warp) | N/A | Returns null (no CLI-accessible session history) |
| Kimi Code | `~/.kimi/sessions/<work_dir_hash>/<sessionId>/wire.jsonl` | Glob across all hash dirs (work_dir hash is opaque) and match on session UUID |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (SQLite `session` table) | Read-only WAL handle; match `directory == cwd` and `time_created` within spawn window |
| Droid | N/A | Returns null (no native session history file; activity flows through PTY-only detection) |
| Ollama | N/A | Returns null (no CLI-accessible session history) |
| Grok Build | `~/.grok/sessions/<encodeURIComponent(cwd)>/<sessionId>/updates.jsonl` | Deterministic path construction (session id is caller-owned via `-s`) plus a strict existence check, scoped to the given cwd (the `resume-cwd-migration` reachability gate depends on a cross-cwd match NOT counting). The attach-time `runtime.sessionHistory.locate` additionally polls ~60s and falls back to a sessions-root scan for encoding mismatches |
| Antigravity CLI | `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<conversationId>/.system_generated/logs/transcript.jsonl` | Direct path computation from the conversation id, with a short existence poll (the transcript appears when the first turn starts) |
| Goose CLI | N/A | Returns null (no transcript parsing; resume rides on the caller-supplied `--name`) |

## Auto-Name (Summarize)

Always-on feature that suggests a task title from the task description, via each adapter's optional `summarize?(prompt, cliPath, cwd)` method. Adapters that omit `summarize` are gated out automatically (Aider and Warp lack a clean plain-text headless mode; Ollama's and Goose's are not yet wired): the renderer hides the button and never schedules the rename toast.

### Surfaces

- **`<NameFromPromptButton>`** (`src/renderer/components/NameFromPromptButton.tsx`) is a square Sparkles icon button placed alongside the title input (not inside it). It exposes a `useNameFromPromptAvailable(description)` hook and is used by `NewTaskDialog` and `TaskDetailEditForm`. The button shows only when the project's default agent declares `supportsSummarize`, the agent CLI is detected, and the description is non-empty.
- **30-second rename toast** (wired in `App.tsx`) fires once per task per app run for placeholder-titled tasks (`fix`, `wip`, etc., or empty). The "don't re-ask" set is persisted in `AppConfig.autoNameAskedTaskIds` (drained on task delete) so a dismissed suggestion does not reappear after restart.

### Implementation

Implementations live next to each adapter and call the shared `runCliPrintSummarize` helper in `src/main/agent/shared/auto-name.ts`. Each adapter picks the right `args`, `promptVia`, and (if needed) `extractRaw`:

| Agent | Invocation | Prompt delivery |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Claude | `claude --print --permission-mode plan` | stdin |
| Codex | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check` | stdin |
| Gemini | `gemini --output-format text` | stdin (non-TTY headless) |
| Qwen Code | `qwen --output-format text` | stdin (non-TTY headless) |
| OpenCode | `opencode run -q` | stdin |
| Kimi | `kimi --print --quiet` | stdin |
| Cursor | `agent --output-format text -p "<prompt>"` | positional arg |
| Droid | `droid exec -o text "<prompt>"` | positional arg |
| Copilot | `copilot --silent -p "<prompt>"` | positional arg |
| Grok Build | `grok --output-format plain -p "<prompt>"` | positional arg |
| Antigravity | `agy -p "<prompt>" --output-format json` through a hidden PTY (`agy -p` hangs without a TTY, upstream #318); runs in a pre-trusted scratch cwd so it never touches the project workspace's `agy -c` mapping | flag arg |
| Aider, Warp | (no clean plain-text headless mode yet) | n/a |
| Ollama | (summarize not yet wired) | n/a |
| Goose CLI | (summarize not yet wired) | n/a |

### Configuration knobs

- `AppConfig.autoNameAskedTaskIds: string[]` - persisted "don't re-ask" set, drained when a task is deleted (single and bulk delete in `task-crud.ts`).
- `AppConfig.autoNameRateLimitPerHour: number` (default 60, 0 disables) - sliding-window cap on summarize CLI calls per hour, enforced in the IPC handler.

### Verification

`node scripts/probe-summarize.js` runs each detected adapter's `summarize()` against a sample description and reports success / timeout / format issues. Run it after installing or upgrading an agent CLI to confirm Kangentic's invocation still produces a sane title.

### Adding summarize to a new adapter

Import `runCliPrintSummarize` and `buildSummarizePrompt` from `../../shared/auto-name`, then add a `summarize()` method choosing the right `args`, `promptVia`, and (if needed) `extractRaw`. Mirror the pattern in `tests/unit/agent-summarize-shape.test.ts`, and set `supportsSummarize: true` on the agent's entry in `tests/ui/mock-electron-api.js`.

## Claude Code

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/claude/detector.ts`

On first use, `ClaudeDetector` locates the Claude CLI:

1. If `config.agent.cliPaths.claude` is set, probe that path and use it. A probe failure is
   reported as configured-but-broken rather than falling through, so an explicit override never
   silently resolves to a different binary
2. Otherwise, search `PATH` using the `which` package. Every match is walked in `which` order (on
   Windows the working directory first, then each `PATH` entry by `PATHEXT`), spending at most
   four version probes per name. An npm `.cmd` / `.bat` / `.ps1` shim whose target script is
   missing is skipped without a probe (`src/main/agent/shared/npm-shim-target.ts`) and does not
   spend the budget, so a stale shim in a project root cannot hide the real install
3. If no `PATH` match answered, probe the well-known fallback paths (`~/.claude/local/claude`,
   then the standard Unix install locations). This is the macOS Finder/Dock launch case, where
   Electron did not inherit the shell `PATH`
4. Cache the result for the app lifetime (`invalidateCache()` resets)

Every probe runs `claude --version` with a 5s timeout. A candidate whose output does not parse as
this agent's version format is passed over and the search continues, so another vendor's binary
publishing the same name cannot be reported as Claude.

Returns `{ found: boolean, path: string | null, version: string | null }`.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/claude/command-builder.ts`

#### New Session

```
claude --settings <mergedSettingsPath> --session-id <uuid> -- "prompt text"
```

- `--session-id <uuid>` creates a new conversation with a known ID (enables resume later)
- `--` separates options from the prompt (prevents prompt content like `--flag` from being parsed as CLI options)
- Prompt has double quotes replaced with single quotes to avoid PowerShell quoting issues

#### Resumed Session

```
claude --settings <mergedSettingsPath> --resume <uuid>
```

- `--resume <uuid>` continues an existing conversation
- No prompt is injected - Claude resumes from its saved context

### Permission Modes

| Mode | CLI Flag |
|------|----------|
| `plan` | `--permission-mode plan` |
| `dontAsk` | `--permission-mode dontAsk` |
| `default` | `--settings <path>` (uses project-settings) |
| `acceptEdits` | `--permission-mode acceptEdits` |
| `auto` | `--permission-mode auto` |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |

#### Permission Mode Resolution (Priority Order)

See [Permission Mode Resolution](configuration.md#permission-mode-resolution-priority-order) in configuration.md.

### Non-Interactive Mode

When `nonInteractive` is set, `--print` is added. The agent runs, prints output, and exits without waiting for user input.

### Settings Merge

For every session, a merged settings file is built at `.kangentic/sessions/<sessionId>/settings.json` (Kangentic's own session record id, not Claude's session id) and passed via `--settings`:

1. Read `.claude/settings.json` from project root (committed, shared)
2. Deep-merge `.claude/settings.local.json` from project root (gitignored, personal)
   - Hooks: concatenated per event type (local hooks appended after project hooks)
   - Permissions: deduplicated union of allow/deny arrays
3. For worktrees: merge permissions from the worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json`
   - Only permissions are merged (captures "always allow" grants from user)
   - Hooks from the worktree are skipped (may be stale leftovers)
4. Inject `statusLine` config pointing to the status bridge script
5. Inject event-bridge hooks into all registered hook points
6. When the MCP server is attached, append `mcp__kangentic` to `permissions.allow` (append-if-absent) so kangentic's own tools never prompt in default mode. `--permission-mode auto` runs a SEPARATE natural-language classifier that does not honor `permissions.allow`, so a plain-language allow rule (`KANGENTIC_AUTO_MODE_ALLOW_RULE`) is also appended to `autoMode.allow` (seeded with `$defaults` when the array is absent, preserving the classifier's built-in rules) so a board-driven auto-mode session does not soft-deny Kangentic's own board/session tools
7. Write merged file to session directory
8. Pass `--settings <mergedSettingsPath>` to the CLI

All Kangentic artifacts stay in `.kangentic/` - nothing is written to `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### Hook Injection

Kangentic subscribes to 18 Claude Code hook points via the event bridge:

| Hook Event | Event Type | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| `PreToolUse` (blank) | `tool_start` | Agent began using a tool |
| `PostToolUse` (blank) | `tool_end` | Tool execution completed (remaps to `background_shell_start` when the `tool_response` carries an id-shaped detail: a backgrounded or auto-backgrounded Bash's shell id, or a `Monitor` wait's `taskId`) |
| `PostToolUseFailure` (blank) | `tool_end` | Tool execution failed (remaps to `interrupted` when `is_interrupt` is true) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `prompt` | User submitted a prompt |
| `Stop` | `idle` | Agent stopped naturally |
| `StopFailure` | `turn_failed` or `turn_retrying` | Fires instead of `Stop` on a service/API error; carries the error type in `detail`. A TERMINAL error stays `turn_failed` (routed through the Interrupted bypass to reset stale counters and idle at once); a TRANSIENT, auto-retried error (overloaded/server_error/rate_limit/api_error) is reclassified to `turn_retrying`, which holds the session thinking through a live retry instead of force-idling it - see [Activity Detection](activity-detection.md) |
| `PermissionRequest` | `idle` | Agent hit a permission wall |
| `SessionStart` | `session_start` | Session began |
| `SessionEnd` | `session_end` | Session ended |
| `SubagentStart` | `subagent_start` | Main agent launched a subagent |
| `SubagentStop` | `subagent_stop` | Subagent finished |
| `Notification` | `notification` | Informational notification |
| `PreCompact` | `compact` | Context compaction starting |
| `TeammateIdle` | `teammate_idle` | Teammate agent went idle |
| `TaskCompleted` | `task_completed` | Task marked complete |
| `ConfigChange` | `config_change` | Configuration changed |
| `WorktreeCreate` | `worktree_create` | Worktree created |
| `WorktreeRemove` | `worktree_remove` | Worktree removed |

All hooks use blank matchers (fire for every invocation regardless of tool name). See [Activity Detection](activity-detection.md) for the full event-to-state mapping and state derivation logic.

#### Hook Identification

Kangentic hooks are identified by two markers in the command string:
- Contains `.kangentic` (path component)
- Contains a known bridge name (`activity-bridge` or `event-bridge`)

Both must match. This two-marker pattern prevents false positives on user-defined hooks with similar names. The `activity-bridge` check is for backwards compatibility with older session directories - the current bridge script is `event-bridge`.

#### Hook Cleanup

`stripKangenticHooks()` in `hook-manager.ts` removes all Kangentic hooks from `.claude/settings.local.json` on project close or delete. This is a backward-compatibility function - the unified `--settings` approach means Kangentic no longer writes hooks to `settings.local.json`, but older worktrees may still have them.

Safety guarantees:
- Backs up the original file before modification
- Validates JSON integrity before writing
- Restores from backup on any error
- Deletes empty settings files and `.claude/` directories

### Global Config Writes (`~/.claude.json`)

`ClaudeAdapter.ensureTrust()` runs before every Claude spawn - both task chokepoints and the Command Terminal (`transient-sessions.ts`) - and performs three read-modify-writes of the global `~/.claude.json`, all serialized through one lock (`withClaudeJsonLock`, `src/main/agent/adapters/claude/claude-json-lock.ts`), which project relocation's key rewrite also takes. Two tests pin that, because one cannot cover both halves: `tests/unit/spawn-entry-point-parity.test.ts` scans every path that builds an agent command and proves the call appears first (line order, all paths), and `tests/unit/transient-session-spawn-ensure-trust.test.ts` drives the Command Terminal handler and proves the runtime contract there (awaited, called once, with the project root, resolving before `buildCommand`).

The lock has two layers. An in-process promise chain serializes Kangentic's own writers. Around it, every operation takes Claude's own `~/.claude.json.lock` (proper-lockfile semantics: a `mkdir` directory, stale after 10 s), because the CLI writes the same file from every running session and one of those writes withdraws the fullscreen boot canary (`fullscreenBootPending[pid]`) on a graceful exit; a Kangentic write that read before that withdrawal and wrote after it resurrects the record, and a dead pid found at the next launch is a strike against the fullscreen renderer. Each writer reads INSIDE the lock. A lock still held after the 12 s budget (which outlasts the stale window, so an abandoned lock is always broken first) makes the writer skip its write and warn, the CLI's own policy on a final `ELOCKED`. `tests/unit/claude-json-lock.test.ts` pins the acquire, the wait, the stale break, and the skip; the rule is `.claude/rules/pty-teardown-grace.md`.

The `/model` picker probe (`model-picker-probe.ts`) is the one other Claude process the adapter spawns. It runs on the classic renderer (`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`), which never arms that canary, and exits the CLI with `/exit`, waiting on the PTY's own exit before the fallback kill.

#### Trust Management

`src/main/agent/adapters/claude/trust-manager.ts`

When spawning an agent in a worktree (CWD differs from project root), `ensureWorktreeTrust()` pre-populates `~/.claude.json` so Claude Code doesn't prompt for trust:

1. Read `~/.claude.json` (or start from empty object if missing/malformed)
2. Find the parent project's trust entry in `projects`
3. Create a new entry for the worktree path with `hasTrustDialogAccepted: true`
4. Copy `enabledMcpjsonServers` from the parent entry (MCP server inheritance)
5. Write back to `~/.claude.json`

Idempotent - skips write if the worktree is already trusted. `ensureMcpServerTrust()` then appends `kangentic` to the project entry's `enabledMcpjsonServers` (append-if-absent) so the Kangentic MCP server is enabled without a prompt.

#### Diff Panel

`src/main/agent/adapters/claude/diff-panel.ts`

Claude Code 2.1.260 opens a diff panel beside the conversation in the fullscreen renderer whenever the terminal is wide enough: the gate is `columns >= 144` when the global `diffSidebarOpen` key is unset, `>= 110` when it is `true`, and never when it is `false`. The panel takes the right `min(floor(columns * 0.45), 90, columns - 70)` columns and shares physical rows with the transcript, so every line-oriented scrollback parse reads the two panes spliced together, and it duplicates the task window's Changes tab.

The key lives only in `~/.claude.json` (the same key list as `theme` and `diffTool`); it is not a settings.json key, so the per-session `--settings` file cannot carry it, and there is no CLI flag or env var. `ensureDiffPanelClosed()` therefore writes `diffSidebarOpen: false` before every spawn:

- Idempotent: an already-`false` key costs one read and no write.
- Per spawn, not once: the key is remembered-last-state in one global slot, and any session that opens the panel (`/diff`) writes `true`, which would otherwise auto-open it in every later Kangentic session.
- Atomic (temp file + rename, no backup copy), and an unreadable file is left untouched rather than replaced, since the file holds the user's auth and MCP state. That guard covers this write only: the two trust writers run earlier in the same `ensureTrust()` and still fall back to an empty object on a parse failure, so a torn file has already lost its other keys before the diff-panel write is reached.
- The CLI applies the value it read at startup: a session spawned with the key `false` stays closed even if another session flips the key to `true` later (verified with a completed turn at 210 columns), so the write covers the session's whole lifetime.
- `/diff` inside a session still opens the panel for that session (that path checks only the git cwd and `columns >= 110`), so it is the per-session opt-in. Turning fullscreen off (`tui: "default"`) would also remove the panel but reintroduces the scrollback duplication fullscreen exists to fix, so it is not used.

## Codex CLI

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/codex/detector.ts`

Detection follows the same pattern as Claude: check `config.agent.cliPaths.codex`, fall back to `PATH` search via `which`, run `codex --version`.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/codex/command-builder.ts`

#### New Session

```
codex -C <cwd> --sandbox <level> --ask-for-approval <level> [--model <m>] \
  -c mcp_servers.kangentic.url=<url> \
  -c mcp_servers.kangentic.env_http_headers.X-Kangentic-Token=KANGENTIC_MCP_TOKEN \
  "prompt text"
```

#### Resumed Session

```
codex resume <sessionId> -C <cwd> --sandbox <level> --ask-for-approval <level> [--model <m>] \
  -c <the same two MCP overrides>
```

Resume is a subcommand in Codex (not a flag like Claude). Both forms emit the same flags: `codex resume` accepts `-c`, `-s/--sandbox`, `-a/--ask-for-approval`, `-m/--model`, `-C/--cd`, and `--disable`. The resume branch used to return early after `-C`, so a resumed session silently lost its permission mode, model override, and MCP wiring.

### MCP Wiring

Codex reads MCP servers from the `mcp_servers.<name>` table in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Kangentic applies the same keys with `-c` for that invocation only, so the user's config file is never written. `env_http_headers` maps a header name to the NAME of an environment variable that Codex resolves at MCP-connect time, so the token travels via `CodexAdapter.buildEnv` as `KANGENTIC_MCP_TOKEN` and never appears in argv (argv is echoed into terminal scrollback the user can read).

**The `-c` payloads deliberately contain no quotes, braces, or whitespace.** `quoteArg` escapes embedded double quotes as `\"` on Windows, which PowerShell does not accept when forwarding to a native command, so the natural TOML inline-table form fails there with `error: unexpected argument 'http://...\' found`. Two properties make the quote-free form work: a bare URL fails TOML parsing and is taken as a literal string, and TOML bare keys permit `-`, so the header name works as a dotted key segment. Verified against codex-cli 0.141.0 on PowerShell, cmd, and Git Bash. Do not "tidy" these into quoted TOML.

### Directory Trust

Codex prompts "Do you trust the contents of this directory?" before it will load project-local config, hooks, or exec policies. Kangentic pre-approves the spawn directory in `~/.codex/config.toml` (`src/main/agent/adapters/codex/trust-manager.ts`):

```toml
[projects.'C:\Users\dev\proj\.kangentic\worktrees\7']
trust_level = "trusted"
```

Measured against codex-cli 0.141.0, this cannot be left to the user answering once. Trust is keyed on the **git repo root** and is **not inherited** by nested repositories, and every Kangentic task gets its own worktree, which is its own repo root. Accepting the prompt therefore records only that one worktree and the next task prompts again: there is no answer the user can give that carries forward. The per-invocation `-c` override does not help either, because trust is resolved before config overrides are applied.

The pre-approval never overrules the user. An explicit `trust_level` already recorded for the directory is left as-is (so a deliberate `"untrusted"` survives), and a project root marked `"untrusted"` suppresses approval for the worktrees beneath it.

Path comparison is shared with the relocation migration (`config-toml.ts`), because Codex stores these keys in several interchangeable spellings (single vs double quotes, forward vs back slashes, and an optional `\\?\` long-path prefix) and a missed match would append a duplicate table, which makes `config.toml` unparsable for Codex itself.

The entry is also **removed** when Kangentic deletes the worktree, via the adapter contract's `onWorktreeRemoved` hook (`removeWorktreeTrust`). Without that, a per-directory key that can never be inherited accumulates one dead table per task forever: one developer machine had reached 473 entries before this landed. Only a table whose sole key is `trust_level` is dropped, so anything the user or a future Codex added to it survives. `$CODEX_HOME` is honored on both the write and the removal, so Kangentic always targets the file Codex will actually read.

### Launch Options

Codex declares one `AgentLaunchOptionInfo` (see [Agent Adapter Interface - Optional Properties](#optional-properties)): `disableApps`, off by default. When enabled, `--disable apps` is appended to both the new-session and `resume` command forms, skipping Codex's optional cloud ChatGPT Apps MCP connector (`apps` feature, stable and on by default per `codex features list`), which can hang the whole session at `Booting MCP server: codex_apps` (openai/codex#20167, #19284, #16550). The flag is per-invocation only - it never touches the user's `~/.codex/config.toml`. Configured via the Agent settings tab's Launch Options row, stored at `agent.launchOptions.codex.disableApps`.

### Permission Modes

| Mode | Flags | Codex Preset |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `plan` | `--sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request` | Safe Read-Only Browsing |
| `dontAsk` | `--sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval never` | Read-Only Non-Interactive (CI) |
| `default` | `--sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval untrusted` | Automatically Edit, Ask for Untrusted |
| `acceptEdits` | `--sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval never` | Auto (Preset) |
| `auto` | `--sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request` | Not exposed in the settings dropdown |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` | Dangerous Full Access |

The Codex Preset column is the adapter's `AgentPermissionEntry.label`, which is what the Agent
settings dropdown shows. Codex declares five entries, so `auto` has no preset of its own. It still
maps to flags, because a column or agent override can set the mode without going through that
dropdown.

### Hook Integration

Kangentic writes no Codex hook file. It used to write a project-local `.codex/hooks.json`, but Codex 0.128 redesigned hooks (they now live in `~/.codex/config.toml` or a Codex plugin folder) and no longer parses that file, printing a yellow "failed to parse hooks config" banner instead. `buildHooks` is therefore a cleanup-only sweep that strips Kangentic-owned entries from any pre-upgrade legacy file; see `codex/hook-manager.ts`.

### Limitations

- No real-time token usage or cost data (no statusLine equivalent)
- No merged settings file mechanism
- No live `/model` or `/reasoning-effort` injection: changing either requires a respawn (`getInjectionSequence` returns `[]`), and effort is `config.toml`-only with no CLI flag

## Gemini CLI

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/gemini/detector.ts`

Detection follows the same pattern: check `config.agent.cliPaths.gemini`, fall back to `PATH` via `which`, run `gemini --version`.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/gemini/command-builder.ts`

#### New Session

```
gemini --approval-mode <mode> "prompt text"
```

Gemini creates sessions implicitly (no `--session-id` equivalent).

#### Resumed Session

```
gemini --resume <sessionId>
```

### Permission Modes

| Mode | Flag | Gemini Mode |
|------|------|-------------|
| `plan` / `dontAsk` | `--approval-mode plan` | Plan (Read-Only Research) |
| `default` | (no flag) | Default (Confirm Actions) |
| `acceptEdits` / `auto` | `--approval-mode auto_edit` | Auto Edit (Auto-Approve Edits) |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--approval-mode yolo` | YOLO (Auto-Approve All) |

### Settings Merge

Gemini reads settings from `.gemini/settings.json` in the project directory. Unlike Claude's `--settings` flag, Gemini has no way to point to a per-session settings file. Kangentic writes merged settings (event-bridge hooks and / or the Kangentic MCP server entry) directly to `.gemini/settings.json` in the CWD.

Because the file is shared, concurrent Gemini sessions in the same project are serialized by a per-task reference counter in `GeminiAdapter.hookHolders`: each `buildCommand` retains a reference keyed by `taskId`, and `removeHooks(directory, taskId)` only strips the file when the last task in that directory releases. Double-calls for the same `taskId` (session-manager invokes `removeHooks` both explicitly in `suspend()` and again from the PTY `onExit` handler) are idempotent. On crash or force-quit, `buildHooks` strips any stale Kangentic entries from the settings file on the next spawn. `removeHooks` strips the `mcpServers.kangentic` entry alongside the hooks, so the per-launch token does not outlive the session. The same refcount pattern lives in `CodexAdapter.hookHolders` (for the legacy `.codex/hooks.json` sweep) and `DroidAdapter.mcpHolders` (for `<cwd>/.factory/mcp.json`).

### MCP Wiring

The merged settings carry an `mcpServers.kangentic` entry using the Gemini-family `httpUrl` key (not the Anthropic/fastmcp `url` used by Claude and Kimi), plus a `headers` map with the per-launch token. This is the same shape the Qwen fork writes. User-defined `mcpServers` are preserved, and `removeHooks` strips only our entry.

The settings write is gated on hooks **or** MCP, so an MCP-only spawn (no events pipeline) still produces the file.

Two things make this work that are easy to miss:

- **Folder trust is load-bearing.** Gemini disables every configured MCP server in an untrusted folder (`gemini mcp list` reports "MCP servers are configured but disabled because this folder is untrusted", and user-level servers are suppressed too), so the entry would be silently inert. `GeminiAdapter.ensureTrust` pre-populates `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` via `trust-manager.ts`. Unlike the Qwen equivalent it does **not** gate on `security.folderTrust.enabled`, because Gemini 0.54.4 enforces trust with that flag unset. It never overrides a user's `TRUST_PARENT` or `DO_NOT_TRUST`, at the path itself or on any ancestor, so a `DO_NOT_TRUST` on the repo suppresses approval for every worktree Kangentic creates beneath it (the same deny rule Codex applies to its project root). It also skips the write when an ancestor is already trusted, so a worktree under an already-trusted repo adds no key at all. When no ancestor is trusted, though, it does record one `TRUST_FOLDER` per task worktree, exactly like Codex - which is why `GeminiAdapter.onWorktreeRemoved` drops that entry again when Kangentic deletes the worktree (`removeWorktreeTrust`). Without it the file grows by a dead entry per task forever, the accumulation that reached 473 entries in Codex's `config.toml`. Removal only ever takes an entry Kangentic could have written itself: a `TRUST_PARENT` or `DO_NOT_TRUST` at that path is a user decision and survives, so a later worktree at the same path still honors it. Ancestor matching folds case only on Windows, since POSIX paths are case-sensitive.
- **The token is plaintext on disk while the session runs.** `.gemini/settings.json` is project-shared and may be intentionally committed, so it cannot be blanket-gitignored like `.kangentic/`. Tokens rotate per app launch and `removeHooks` strips the entry on exit. For the untracked case this is now self-enforcing: when Kangentic creates the file (it did not exist before the spawn), the builder seeds `.gemini/settings.json` and `.kangentic/` into `.git/info/exclude` via the shared `git-exclude.ts` mechanism (see the Antigravity section), so the file never shows as untracked and cannot ride a `git add -A` into history. A pre-existing file keeps its normal git visibility (the created-by-us carve-out), and ignore rules never affect tracked files - so the rule stands: do not commit `.gemini/settings.json` while a Kangentic-spawned Gemini session is running. Droid avoids this class of problem entirely because it supports `${NAME}` env expansion inside header values; Gemini does not.

## Qwen Code

Qwen Code (https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) is a soft fork of Google's gemini-cli published by the Alibaba Qwen team. The Kangentic adapter mirrors the Gemini adapter: same hook event schema, same session JSON layout, same TUI behavior. Three deltas matter for users.

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/qwen-code/detector.ts`

Detection follows the standard pattern: check `config.agent.cliPaths.qwen`, fall back to `PATH` via `which`, run `qwen --version`. Version output is the raw version string with no product-name prefix or suffix (inherited from gemini-cli), so `parseVersion` is identity.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/qwen-code/command-builder.ts`

#### New Session

```
qwen --approval-mode <mode> --session-id <uuid> "prompt text"
```

Kangentic generates a UUID up front and passes it via `--session-id`, mirroring Claude. Qwen 0.15.3+ honors caller-owned UUIDs and writes its session JSONL at exactly `<our-uuid>.jsonl`.

#### Resumed Session

```
qwen --resume <sessionId>
```

`--session-id` and `--resume` are mutually exclusive (yargs enforces). The command builder picks the correct flag based on the `resume` option.

### Permission Modes

| Mode | Flag | Qwen Mode |
|------|------|-----------|
| `plan` / `dontAsk` | `--approval-mode plan` | Plan (Read-Only Research) |
| `default` | (no flag) | Default (Confirm Actions) |
| `acceptEdits` / `auto` | `--approval-mode auto-edit` | Auto Edit (Auto-Approve Edits) |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--approval-mode yolo` | YOLO (Auto-Approve All) |

The fork swapped Gemini's `auto_edit` (underscore) flag value for `auto-edit` (hyphen). The unit tests guard against the underscore form regressing.

### Settings Merge

Qwen Code reads settings from `.qwen/settings.json` in the project directory. Like Gemini it has no `--settings` flag, so Kangentic writes merged settings (with event-bridge hooks) directly to `.qwen/settings.json` in the CWD. Concurrent sessions in the same project are serialized by a per-task reference counter in `QwenAdapter.hookHolders`, identical to the Gemini implementation.

The security trade-off is also identical to Gemini's: the merged file carries the per-launch MCP token in plaintext while the session runs. The same mitigations apply - tokens rotate per app launch, `removeHooks` strips the entry on exit, and when Kangentic creates the file the builder seeds `.qwen/settings.json` and `.kangentic/` into `.git/info/exclude` (created-by-us carve-out: a pre-existing user file keeps its git visibility). Do not commit `.qwen/settings.json` while a Kangentic-spawned Qwen session is running.

### Session History

Native chat session JSONL file:

```
~/.qwen/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/chats/<sessionId>.jsonl
```

`<sanitized-cwd>` is the cwd lowercased (on Windows) with every non-alphanumeric character replaced
by `-`, so `C:\Users\dev\proj` becomes `c--users-dev-proj`. The filename is exactly the session UUID
with no prefix or timestamp, and since Kangentic supplies that UUID via `--session-id`, `locate()`
is direct path construction rather than a directory scan.

Verified against Qwen Code 0.15.3 on disk. Qwen is a gemini-cli fork but moved chat persistence
entirely: it does NOT use Gemini's `~/.gemini/tmp/<basename>/chats/session-<timestamp><shortId>.json`
layout. See the note at the top of `qwen-code/session-history-parser.ts`.

The parser walks the `messages[]` array backwards to find the most recent assistant message and reads its `model` + `tokens` fields. Both `type: 'qwen'` (rebranded build) and `type: 'gemini'` (some forks retain the upstream literal) are accepted.

Context window size is read straight off the event: Qwen records a real `contextWindowSize` on every assistant event, so there is no lookup table to maintain. A missing field (older builds) falls through to the `0` sentinel, and the renderer hides the progress bar and shows only the model name.

### Session ID Capture

Caller-owned via `--session-id <uuid>`, mirroring Claude. `supportsCallerSessionId` is `true`. Empirically verified against Qwen 0.15.3: real qwen accepts a UUID and writes its JSONL at exactly `~/.qwen/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/chats/<our-uuid>.jsonl`. `--session-id` and `--resume` are mutex (yargs enforces). The runtime keeps `fromHook` and `fromOutput` capture paths as belt-and-suspenders for forks that pre-empt the caller's UUID.

### Limitations / Out of Scope

- **No statusLine telemetry:** Qwen Code (like Gemini) has no `status.json` token-streaming feature, so context window % is sourced from the session history file rather than a real-time hook.
- **OpenAI gpt-5 family unsupported (upstream bug):** Qwen Code 0.15.3's bundled `cli.js` sends `max_tokens` in OpenAI requests and never `max_completion_tokens`. OpenAI's gpt-5 family (e.g. gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5.1, and any gpt-5.x / gpt-5.x-codex variant) requires `max_completion_tokens` and rejects `max_tokens` with HTTP 400. Picking any gpt-5 variant via `/model` in the Qwen TUI surfaces `[API Error: 400 Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead.]`. Workarounds until upstream patches: stay on the gpt-4.1 family for OpenAI, or use the Anthropic provider (Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5) which is fully supported. Kangentic cannot work around this - the adapter is a pure CLI wrapper with no request-parameter interception. Tracked upstream at https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code (search issues for `max_completion_tokens`).

## OpenCode

### CLI Detection

`config.agent.cliPaths.opencode` override, then `PATH` lookup for `opencode` (with the `.cmd` shim on Windows for `npm i -g opencode-ai` installs; under a PowerShell or Git Bash host the spawn chokepoint launches the sibling `.ps1` or sh shim instead, see [cross-platform.md](cross-platform.md#npm-cmd-shims-under-powershell-and-git-bash)), then the standard Unix fallback paths. Distributed via Homebrew, Scoop, Chocolatey, Pacman, the curl|sh installer, and `npm i -g opencode-ai` - all install methods publish the same `opencode` binary name. The version probe runs `opencode --version` and strips an optional `opencode ` product prefix from the output.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/opencode/command-builder.ts`

```
opencode [--session <id>] [--prompt <text>]
```

Important shape constraints (verified against /anomalyco/opencode docs):

- The TUI's positional argument is a **project directory**, not a prompt. Initial prompts must go through `--prompt <text>` or OpenCode tries to chdir into the prompt text. The PTY layer already sets the shell cwd, so Kangentic never emits a positional or `--dir` value.
- Resume uses `--session <id>` (alias `-s`) on the TUI command - not the `run` subcommand. The prompt is omitted on resume so the user continues the prior conversation (mirrors Claude's `--resume` convention).
- Windows shells get embedded `"` characters in the prompt rewritten to `'` to keep the cmd.exe / PowerShell quoting parser happy.

### Permission Modes

The `permissions` list exposes two entries in OpenCode's own vocabulary: `plan` (label "Plan", OpenCode's built-in read-only agent) and `acceptEdits` (label "Build", full tool access). The stored `PermissionMode` enum values are reused for compatibility, so a swimlane set to `acceptEdits` under Claude continues to mean "Build" under OpenCode. Both entries are **informational** today - they produce the same CLI invocation. There is no `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag in TUI mode (it exists only on the non-interactive `opencode run` subcommand), and no per-mode flag set. Historical values outside this list (`default`, `bypassPermissions`, `dontAsk`, `auto`) are still accepted by `mapPermissionModeToAgent` for backward compatibility with mixed-agent projects. Users who want auto-approval must enable it in `opencode.json`. The default mode is `acceptEdits`.

### Settings Merge

None. OpenCode reads MCP and provider configuration from `opencode.json` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (global). `clearSettingsCache` has nothing to clear, and `removeHooks` only removes the activity plugin (next subsection). The Kangentic MCP server IS wired in for a local-mode spawn - `buildOpenCodeEnv` (`command-builder.ts`) emits an inline `mcp.kangentic` entry via the `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` env var per PTY spawn, deep-merged over the user's own config so their `mcp.*` entries are preserved (see [MCP Server](mcp-server.md)). It is NOT wired in for a remote-mode spawn (`opencode attach <url>`) - see the Remote Execution subsection below.

### Activity Plugin

Local-mode spawns install the Kangentic activity plugin by copying `kangentic-activity.mjs` into `<projectRoot>/.opencode/plugins/`, where OpenCode auto-discovers plugins at TUI startup. The copy is byte-compare idempotent, and removal verifies a sentinel comment on line 1 so a user-authored plugin at the same path is never touched. The plugin runs inline in the OpenCode process and writes activity events straight to the session's `events.jsonl`, reading its output path from the `KANGENTIC_EVENTS_PATH` env var exported by the PTY spawn flow. Note the install lands at the PROJECT ROOT, not the task worktree.

The plugin file is hidden from git via the shared `.git/info/exclude` mechanism (`src/main/agent/shared/git-exclude.ts`, see the Antigravity section), seeded only once the plugin file actually exists at the destination so a failed copy never leaves an entry pointing at a missing file. Earlier releases appended the entry to the project's tracked `.gitignore` instead, which dirtied the user's checkout; a line those releases appended is left in place (harmless - it ignores the same path).

### Session ID Capture

Not caller-owned (`supportsCallerSessionId = false`). Two capture pathways run concurrently and the first to succeed wins:

- **`sessionId.fromOutput`:** `SessionIdScanner` strips ANSI escapes from each PTY chunk and matches against `(?:session(?:[ _-]?id)?|sid)` and `--session` flag forms. Accepts both OpenCode's native `ses_<16-64 alphanumeric>` shape (verified empirically on v1.14.25, e.g. `ses_2349b5c91ffeKd6qajuUTR4clq`) and canonical UUID format.
- **`sessionId.fromFilesystem`:** Polls the OpenCode SQLite database at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (read-only, WAL-friendly handle) for a `session` row whose `directory` equals the spawn cwd and whose `time_created` falls within `[spawnedAt - 5s, spawnedAt + 30s]`. Polls every 500 ms for up to ~10 s. Direct DB read avoids ~200-500 ms `opencode` CLI spin-up per poll, and avoids the Windows `child_process.execFile` rejection of `.cmd` shims.

### Remote Execution

OpenCode is the only adapter that declares `remoteExecution` (see [Agent Adapter Interface](#agent-adapter-interface) above and [configuration.md - Remote Execution](configuration.md#remote-execution) for the config shape). When a project's mode for OpenCode is `remote`:

- **Command:** `command-builder.ts`'s `buildOpenCodeAttachCommand` emits `opencode attach <url> [--dir <serverPath>] [--username u] [--password p]` instead of the local TUI form. `--model` is never emitted - the server is the authority for providers and models. Resume uses `--session <id>` exactly as in local mode.
- **Auth:** `probeAuth()` (the local `auth.json` check) is bypassed. `remoteExecution.probeServer` (`remote-client.ts`'s `probeOpenCodeServer`) hits `GET <url>/global/health` instead, surfaced via the `agent:probeExecutionServer` IPC channel and the Agent settings tab's "Test connection" button.
- **Session ID capture:** `sessionId.fromFilesystem` (the local SQLite poll) is skipped for a remote-mode cwd - `sessionId.fromOutput` (the PTY scan) is the sole capture path. This also means the "concurrent same-cwd spawns cannot be disambiguated" caveat below does not apply to remote sessions.
- **Transcript:** `parseTranscript` fetches `GET <url>/session/:id/message` (`remote-client.ts`'s `fetchOpenCodeSessionMessages`) instead of reading the local SQLite database, mapped into the same `TranscriptEntry[]` shape by `mapOpenCodeRemoteEntries` (a distinct mapper from the local `mapOpenCodeRows` - the wire shape is `{info, parts}[]`, not SQLite rows).
- **Activity plugin:** not installed - the plugin file would need to land on the server's filesystem, which Kangentic has no access to. PTY-silence activity detection (already the fallback tier of `hooks_and_pty`) carries activity for remote sessions.
- **MCP:** not wired. `buildOpenCodeEnv` returns `null` whenever `options.executionTarget` is set (loopback or genuinely remote target - both). This is architectural, not a reachability problem: `opencode attach <url>` is a stateless HTTP client to a server that was started, and had its config fixed, independently and earlier - its CLI surface exposes no config-push flags (verified against `opencode attach --help`), so env vars Kangentic sets on the spawned attach process are never read by the already-running server. Kangentic's `mcpServer.bindAddress`/`callbackHost` settings (see [MCP Server > Network Access](mcp-server.md)) make the server itself LAN/VPN-reachable, but cannot make `attach` push config into a server it does not control the startup of.
- **Worktree:** `ensureTaskWorktree` (`src/main/ipc/helpers/task-git.ts`) skips creating a local git worktree for a task whose resolved agent is remote-mode; the configured server working directory travels via `executionTarget`, never through `task.worktree_path`.
- **Handoff:** `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns `null` for a remote-mode cwd - cross-agent handoff degrades to the PTY-scrollback cleanup fallback, since there is no local history file to reference.

The adapter tracks which cwd resolved to which remote target in an in-memory `Map` populated by `buildCommand` (mirrors the existing `hookHolders` pattern), since `parseTranscript` / `locateSessionHistoryFile` / `sessionId.fromFilesystem` have no other way to reach Kangentic's `AppConfig` (adapters hold no config reference by design). Known limitation: this map is empty after an app restart, so viewing an old remote session's transcript falls back to the (empty) local SQLite lookup until the task is resumed again.

### Limitations

- **Concurrent same-cwd spawns cannot be disambiguated (local mode only):** Two OpenCode tasks spawned within ~30 s against the same `cwd` cannot be reliably distinguished by `captureSessionIdFromFilesystem`. Both rows match the directory + time-window predicate, so the parser returns the most recently created row - which can attribute task A's session ID to task B, or vice versa. Kangentic's per-task worktrees (`git.worktreesEnabled`, default `true`) sidestep this by giving every task its own `cwd`. If you have disabled worktrees and need to run multiple OpenCode tasks against the same project root, either re-enable worktrees in Settings -> Git or stagger the spawns by more than 30 seconds. The Codex CLI parser carries the same caveat. Does not apply to remote-mode sessions (see above).
- **No status.json pipeline:** activity is `hooks_and_pty` - the activity plugin's events are authoritative when they fire, and PTY-silence detection (`PTY_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS`, same `PtyActivityTracker` shape as Codex) is the fallback tier for sessions without the plugin (remote mode, failed install). OpenCode has no statusline, so there is no `status.json` pipeline.
- **No trust dialog:** `ensureTrust` is a no-op. OpenCode does not prompt for directory trust on first run.
- **Remote mode is single-directory per project:** the server working directory is per-project, not per-task, so concurrent remote tasks in the same project share one directory. Per-task remote worktrees would require remote git operations (OpenCode's `POST /session/:id/shell` is the mechanism, if pursued later).

## Aider

### CLI Detection

Detection is inlined in the adapter (no separate detector class): check `config.agent.cliPaths.aider`, fall back to `PATH` via `which`, run `aider --version`. The version output (`aider 86.2`) is parsed to strip the product name prefix.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/aider/aider-adapter.ts`

```
aider --message "prompt text" --chat-mode <mode> --no-auto-commits
```

- `--message` delivers the prompt (shell-safe quoting applied)
- `--no-auto-commits` prevents Aider from auto-committing (Kangentic manages git)

### Permission Modes

| Mode | Flags | Aider Mode |
|------|-------|------------|
| `plan` / `dontAsk` | `--chat-mode ask` | Ask (Read-Only Questions) |
| `default` | (no flags) | Code (Confirm Changes) |
| `acceptEdits` / `auto` | `--architect` | Architect (Two-Model Design) |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--yes` | Auto Yes (Skip Confirmations) |

### Limitations

- No session resume (no `--resume` equivalent)
- No structured status or event output
- No hooks, settings merge, or trust mechanism
- No TUI alternate screen - uses streaming text output

## Cursor CLI

### CLI Detection

Detection uses the shared `AgentDetector` with binary name `cursor-agent` and `binaryAliases: ['agent']`.

Cursor installs BOTH shims, and the short one is not its alone: xAI's Grok CLI also installs `agent`, and on Windows its `agent.exe` beats Cursor's `agent.cmd` in PATHEXT order. Detecting on `agent` therefore made Cursor **undetectable** on any machine that also had Grok - the probe resolved, ran Grok's binary, and Cursor was reported missing. Probing the unambiguous name first is the fix; the alias keeps working where only `agent` exists.

Two supporting details make the fallback safe. `parseVersion` accepts `1.0.0`, `agent 1.0.0`, or `Cursor Agent 1.0.0` and rejects anything else, so Grok's own version banner fails the probe rather than passing as Cursor. And the PATH loop CONTINUES to the next candidate when a name resolves but fails its version probe, instead of aborting - without that, finding Grok's `agent` would still end the search. Pinned by `tests/unit/cursor-grok-binary-collision.test.ts`.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/cursor/cursor-adapter.ts`

#### New Session (Interactive)

```
agent "prompt text"
```

User confirms changes in the PTY. Default mode.

#### New Session (Non-Interactive)

```
agent -p "prompt text" --output-format stream-json
```

Selected when `permissionMode === 'bypassPermissions'` or `nonInteractive` is set. Has full write access. The NDJSON `init` event carries `session_id`, which `runtime.sessionId.fromOutput` captures for resume.

#### Resumed Session

```
agent --resume="<chat-id>"
```

The `=` sits outside the quote boundary (`--resume='id'` on unix, `--resume="id"` on Windows).

### Permission Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Cursor Mode |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `default` | (no special flag) | Interactive (Confirm Changes) |
| `bypassPermissions` | `-p ... --output-format stream-json` | Non-Interactive (Full Access) |

### Limitations

- No hooks, no structured status pipeline (PTY silence timer only)
- No settings merge, no trust mechanism
- No `transcript-cleanup.ts` (uses streaming text output, not a TUI alternate screen)
- `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns null. The location is no longer unknown - Cursor writes
  `~/.cursor/projects/<cwd-slug>/agent-transcripts/<sessionId>/<sessionId>.jsonl` plus a per-session
  `store.db` - but two things block wiring it in: the records carry NO timestamp, and the stored
  text is WRAPPED (`<user_query>...</user_query>`) rather than the raw submitted text. See
  [Command Injection - Cursor](command-injection.md#cursor-located-not-yet-verified). Cursor was
  also measured as turn-end flushed, so it gets no `command-injection` verifier either.

## GitHub Copilot CLI

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/copilot/detector.ts`

Detection follows the standard pattern: check `config.agent.cliPaths.copilot`, fall back to `PATH` via `which`, run `copilot --version`.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/copilot/command-builder.ts`

Copilot CLI v1.0+ supports caller-owned session IDs via `--resume <uuid>` (same semantics as Claude's `--session-id`): passing a new UUID starts a fresh session with that ID, passing an existing UUID resumes it.

Per-session config is written to `<eventsOutputPath dir>/copilot-config/`, enabling inline hooks (`preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `agentStop`, `preCompact`) and `statusLine`. The adapter tracks these directories keyed by project root and `taskId` so `removeHooks(directory, taskId?)` can clean up the right one.

### Permission Modes

| Mode | Flag | Copilot Mode |
|------|------|--------------|
| `plan` | `--plan` | Plan (Read-Only) |
| `dontAsk` | `--plan` (non-interactive) | Plan Non-Interactive (CI) |
| `default` | (no flag) | Default (Confirm Actions) |
| `acceptEdits` | (configured tool allowlist) | Allow All Tools |
| `auto` | (configured tool allowlist) | Autopilot (Allow All Tools) |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--yolo` | YOLO (Full Access) |

`defaultPermission` is `acceptEdits`.

### Status & Events

The `CopilotStatusParser` reads a `status.json` written by Copilot's `statusLine` config (full-rewrite). Activity uses `hooksAndPty` - hooks primary, PTY silence timer as fallback.

### Limitations

- No `transcript-cleanup.ts` despite being a TUI agent (`\x1b[?25l` cursor hide). Handoff transcripts may contain rendering artifacts.
- `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns null - file location is not yet empirically verified.
- Trust is handled at runtime via `--add-dir`, not pre-approved.

## Oz CLI (Warp)

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/warp/warp-adapter.ts` (the detection walk),
`src/main/agent/adapters/warp/version-detector.ts` (the version command and its parser)

Detection is custom because `oz` does not support `--version` - it uses `dump-debug-info` instead. The detector inlines the same caching and inflight-deduplication pattern as `AgentDetector` but with the alternate version command. Override path is checked first, then `which('oz')` falls back to PATH. Because it does not use the shared `AgentDetector`, `oz` resolves only `which`'s first match and gets neither the multi-match walk nor the dead-shim skip described under Claude.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/warp/warp-adapter.ts`

```
oz agent run -C <cwd> --name <taskId> -- --prompt "prompt text"
```

- `oz agent run` is a one-shot cloud agent runner - it streams output then exits
- `-C <cwd>` sets the working directory
- `--name <taskId>` provides traceability/grouping
- `--` end-of-options guard prevents prompt content starting with `-` from being parsed as a flag

### Permission Modes

Warp manages permissions via agent profiles (`--profile <ID>`), not individual CLI flags. The labels below are informational only - no permission-mode-to-flag mapping exists in `buildCommand()`.

| Mode | Oz Mode |
|------|---------|
| `plan` | Plan Only (Read-Only) |
| `default` | Default |
| `bypassPermissions` | Auto (Skip Confirmations) |

### Limitations

- No session resume (`oz agent run` is one-shot)
- No hooks, no settings merge, no trust mechanism
- No structured status or event output - PTY silence timer is the sole idle detection
- No `transcript-cleanup.ts` (streams text output, not a TUI alternate screen)
- `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns null - no CLI-accessible session history

## Kimi Code

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/kimi/kimi-adapter.ts`

Kimi is a Python tool installed via `uv tool install kimi-cli` (the upstream installer at `code.kimi.com/install.sh`). Both `kimi` and `kimi-cli` PATH entries map to the same `src/kimi_cli:__main__` entry point. Detection uses `AgentDetector` with a `kimi --version` probe (output format: `kimi, version 1.37.0`). Fallback paths cover the uv-tool prefix on macOS/Linux (`~/.local/share/uv/tools/kimi-cli/bin/kimi`) and Windows (`%APPDATA%\uv\tools\kimi-cli\Scripts\kimi.exe` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` equivalent).

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/kimi/command-builder.ts`

```
kimi -w <cwd> [--session <uuid> | --continue] [--plan|--yolo] [--print --output-format stream-json] [--mcp-config '<json>'] [--prompt "<text>"]
```

Flag mapping (verified empirically with kimi v1.37.0):

| PermissionMode | Kimi flag |
|----------------|-----------|
| `plan` | `--plan` |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--yolo` |
| `default` / `acceptEdits` / `dontAsk` / `auto` | (no flag - interactive confirms) |

- `-w <cwd>` always passed; the path is forward-slashed so PowerShell and bash both parse it correctly.
- `--session <uuid>` is used for both *create* (caller-owned UUID) and *resume*. Kimi's `Session.create(work_dir, session_id="...")` SDK API maps to the same flag, so we set `supportsCallerSessionId = true` and own the ID end-to-end.
- `--continue` is emitted when the builder's `useContinueFallback` option is set and no `sessionId` is supplied. It tells Kimi to resume the most recent session for `cwd`, covering three cases: recovering after a lost DB record, attaching to a session started by a manual `kimi` invocation in the same `work_dir`, or driving a "Resume last session" UI affordance from the command-terminal overlay. Precedence: when both `sessionId` and `useContinueFallback` are provided, the explicit `--session <uuid>` always wins.
- `--prompt <text>` is the canonical non-interactive prompt entry. Quoting follows the same shell-safe rules as the other adapters.
- `--mcp-config <JSON>` is synthesized when `mcpServerEnabled` is true; the payload is a minimal fastmcp-compatible config naming Kangentic's HTTP MCP server with the `X-Kangentic-Token` header.

### Session ID Capture

Two PTY regex anchors plus a filesystem fallback:

1. **Welcome banner**: `Session: <uuid>` printed in the cyan startup box (interactive and `--print`).
2. **Print-mode exit**: `To resume this session: kimi -r <uuid>` written to stderr at session end.
3. **Filesystem fallback**: `runtime.sessionId.fromFilesystem` scans this spawn's own work_dir directory - `~/.kimi/sessions/<md5(cwd)>/` (and its `<kaos>_<md5(cwd)>` variant) - for UUID directories whose mtime is within ±30s of the spawn time, returning the newest. Scoping to the spawn's own work_dir hash (rather than globbing every hash dir) keeps a concurrent Kimi session in another work_dir, or a `-w`-less probe's stray session, from winning the recency race and poisoning the captured id.

### Session History

`src/main/agent/adapters/kimi/session-history-parser.ts` + `wire-parser.ts`

Kimi writes `wire.jsonl` to `~/.kimi/sessions/<work_dir_hash>/<sessionId>/` on every spawn (interactive or `--print`). The work_dir hash is `md5(absolute work_dir)`. The history locator (`locate()`, given a known session UUID) globs across all hash dirs and matches on the UUID, so it is robust to the same directory opened under different paths. This differs from the capture fallback above, which has no known UUID and so is scoped to the spawn's own work_dir hash to avoid mis-attributing another work_dir's session.

The file is append-only (resume via `-r <uuid>` appends new `TurnBegin` / `TurnEnd` lines). Format:

```jsonl
{"type": "metadata", "protocol_version": "1.9"}
{"timestamp": <unix_seconds>, "message": {"type": "<EventName>", "payload": {...}}}
```

Every documented wire-protocol message type (19 Events + 4 Requests, wire protocol v1.9) is parsed:

**Events**

| Wire event | Activity | SessionEvent |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| `TurnBegin` | → Thinking | `Prompt` (detail = extracted user_input text) |
| `TurnEnd` | → Idle | (none) |
| `StepBegin` | → Thinking | (none) |
| `StepInterrupted` | → Idle | `Interrupted` |
| `CompactionBegin` | → Thinking | `Compact` |
| `CompactionEnd` | (preserve) | (none) |
| `StatusUpdate` | (preserve) | (none; updates SessionUsage) |
| `ContentPart` | (preserve) | (none; streaming text fragment) |
| `ToolCall` | (preserve) | `ToolStart` (detail = tool name) |
| `ToolCallPart` | (preserve) | (none; argument-streaming fragment) |
| `ToolResult` | (preserve) | `ToolEnd` (detail = `ok` or `error`) |
| `ApprovalResponse` | → Thinking | `Notification` (detail = response) |
| `SubagentEvent` | (preserve) | `SubagentStart` (inner `TurnBegin`) / `SubagentStop` (inner `TurnEnd`) / `Notification` (other inner types). detail = `subagent_type` \|\| `agent_id` \|\| `subagent` |
| `BtwBegin` | (preserve) | `SubagentStart` (detail = `btw`) |
| `BtwEnd` | (preserve) | `SubagentStop` (detail = `btw`) |
| `SteerInput` | → Thinking | `Prompt` (detail = extracted user_input text) |
| `PlanDisplay` | (preserve) | `Notification` (detail = file_path) |
| `HookTriggered` | (preserve) | `Notification` (detail = `<event>:<target>`) |
| `HookResolved` | (preserve) | `Notification` (detail = `<event>:<action> (<reason>)`) |

**Requests** (Wire protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0; the parser is a passive observer that surfaces requests as activity-state telemetry):

| Wire request | Activity | SessionEvent |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| `ApprovalRequest` | → Idle | `Idle` (detail = `IdleReason.Permission`) |
| `ToolCallRequest` | (preserve) | `ToolStart` (detail = `name`) |
| `QuestionRequest` | → Idle | `Idle` (detail = `IdleReason.Permission`) |
| `HookRequest` | (preserve) | `Notification` (detail = `<event>:<target>[: <summary>]`, summary derived from `input_data` and capped at 200 chars) |

The parser uses an exhaustive `switch` over a `KIMI_DISPATCH_TYPES` literal union, so a future protocol bump that adds a new type produces a TS exhaustiveness error at compile time. `user_input` (TurnBegin / SteerInput) accepts both `string` and `ContentPart[]`; the parser extracts `TextPart.text` from arrays and ignores think/media parts.

### Permission Modes

Kimi exposes only two permission flags. The adapter surfaces three modes:

| Mode | Kimi behavior |
|------|---------------|
| `plan` | Read-only (`--plan`) |
| `default` | Interactive confirmation per action (no flag) |
| `bypassPermissions` | Auto-approve all (`--yolo`) |

### Authentication

`KimiAdapter.probeAuth()` checks for `~/.kimi/credentials/` (the OAuth state directory written by `kimi login`). The probe is invoked by the `IPC.AGENT_LIST` handler after `detect()` reports `found: true` and surfaces a tristate field `authenticated: true | false | null` on `AgentDetectionInfo`:

- `true` - credentials directory exists and is non-empty
- `false` - directory missing or empty (user has not run `kimi login`)
- `null` - I/O error or probe not implemented

The renderer surfaces the `false` state two ways: an amber `DetectionCard` variant on the welcome-screen agent grid (with a "Copy `kimi login`" clipboard button), and an amber pill plus inline hint in Settings -> Agent. Refreshing the agent list (welcome-screen Refresh, Settings re-detect button, or reopening the settings panel) re-runs the probe and clears the warning once the user has logged in.

Filesystem check chosen over a `kimi info` subprocess: the probe runs on every `AGENT_LIST` call alongside the existing `--version` probes, and a single sub-millisecond `fs.readdirSync` (with ENOENT mapped to `false`) keeps the refresh latency unchanged. An expired-token false-positive (credentials present but not valid) still falls through to today's behavior - the spawned session prints "LLM not set" and exits.

`probeAuth?()` is an optional method on the `AgentAdapter` interface; Kimi and Grok implement it today (Grok via `grok models` output, see [Grok Build](#grok-build)). Other adapters return `undefined` for the `authenticated` field, which the renderer treats as "not applicable".

### Limitations

- No hook injection (Kimi reads `~/.kimi/config.toml` `hooks = []` but has no per-project settings file equivalent we can write to)
- No trust dialog (`ensureTrust` is a no-op)
- We do not initiate the OAuth flow on the user's behalf - see Authentication above for how the unauthenticated state is detected and surfaced

## Droid

### CLI Detection

`src/main/agent/adapters/droid/detector.ts`

Droid is Factory's coding agent CLI (the `droid` binary). Detection follows the standard `AgentDetector` flow with a `droid --version` probe. Output is either `droid <semver>` or bare `<semver>`; `parseVersion` strips the optional `droid` product prefix and returns the trimmed version string. Standard Unix fallback paths are wired via `standardUnixFallbackPaths('droid')` for cases where the binary is not on `PATH`. Refer to Factory's documentation for the current install command.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/droid/command-builder.ts`

```
droid --cwd <cwd> [--resume <uuid>] "<prompt>"
```

Empirically validated against Droid 0.109.1 (see `scripts/probe-droid.js`). The adapter is intentionally minimal - the bare command with cwd + optional resume + prompt is the production path. Other CLI behavior (model picker, autonomy mode, BYOK) is configured in Droid's TUI and persisted in `~/.factory/settings.json`. Trying to shadow these with Kangentic-managed `--settings` overrides was rejected by user feedback as unnecessary custom layering.

### Session ID Capture

`src/main/agent/adapters/droid/session-id-capture.ts`

`captureSessionIdFromFilesystem` polls `~/.factory/sessions/<cwd-slug>/` (up to 20 attempts at 500ms) for `<uuid>.jsonl` files whose mtime is at or above `spawnedAt - 30s`, and returns the UUID with the newest qualifying mtime. The cwd slug normalizes path separators and the drive-letter colon to `-` (e.g. `C:\Users\dev\project` -> `-C-Users-dev-project`). Concurrent Droid spawns in the same cwd within the 30s floor can collide; per-task worktrees are the recommended mitigation.

### Permission Modes

Droid does not accept a CLI flag for autonomy mode. The adapter surfaces a single `default` mode and the user cycles autonomy in the TUI directly (shift+tab toggles low/medium/high). Kangentic does not translate `permissionMode` into a flag override.

### MCP Setup

Droid CLI has no per-spawn `--mcp-config` flag, but it does expand `${NAME}` references against the process environment inside `headers` values at connect time, and never rewrites the file with the expanded value. Kangentic uses that: on spawn it writes a project-scoped `<cwd>/.factory/mcp.json` holding only the environment variable NAME, and supplies the value through the adapter's `buildEnv`. `~/.factory/mcp.json` is never touched, and the token never reaches disk even though the file lives inside the user's repo.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kangentic": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "<kangenticMcpUrl>",
      "headers": { "X-Kangentic-Token": "${KANGENTIC_MCP_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

User-defined servers in that file are preserved, and `removeHooks` strips only the `kangentic` entry on session exit (deleting the file when nothing else remains). Verified against droid 0.189.0: `droid mcp list` reports `kangentic  http  connected  [project]`.

Cleanup runs from the PTY exit and suspend paths, so a hard kill (Task Manager, crash, OS reboot) leaves the entry behind pointing at a dead loopback port until the next spawn rewrites it. It holds no secret, but it is a file Kangentic wrote inside the user's tree, so when Kangentic creates it the builder seeds `.factory/mcp.json` and `.kangentic/` into `.git/info/exclude` via the shared `git-exclude.ts` mechanism (see the Antigravity section) - the file never shows as untracked and cannot ride a `git add -A`. A pre-existing user `mcp.json` keeps its normal git visibility (the created-by-us carve-out). A Droid session on a project with worktrees disabled writes it into the project root rather than a worktree, which is what makes that entry matter.

### Limitations

#### No live telemetry (model, cost, tokens, context window)

Droid 0.109.x has no per-session telemetry channel that Kangentic can subscribe to. The three documented surfaces all sit outside the live-streaming contract that `ContextBar` requires:

- **`/cost` and `/context` slash commands** - post-hoc and user-initiated inside the TUI, not a stream Kangentic can read.
- **`OTEL_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`** - out-of-band OpenTelemetry export to a collector. Not a per-session signal we can subscribe to from the main process.
- **`~/.factory/sessions/<cwd-slug>/<uuid>.settings.json`** - written post-hoc, schema undocumented and unstable. Empirical parsing was evaluated and rejected (see "Out of scope" below).

As a result, `SessionUsage` is never populated for Droid sessions. The Droid adapter declares `liveTelemetryUnsupported` (carrying a label and tooltip) on `AgentAdapter`, the field flows to the renderer through `AgentDetectionInfo`, and `ContextBar` reads the generic capability and renders a "Telemetry: TUI only" pill (with the adapter-supplied tooltip) in place of the loading spinner. The renderer never branches on agent name. Users get live telemetry by running `/cost` or `/context` directly inside the Droid TUI.

Tracked upstream at [Factory-AI/factory#TBD](https://github.com/Factory-AI/factory/issues) - once a per-session streaming channel ships (status file, named pipe, or `stream-json` on interactive `droid`), wire a `runtime.sessionHistory` (or `runtime.statusFile` / `runtime.streamOutput`) parser in `src/main/agent/adapters/droid/` and remove `liveTelemetryUnsupported` from the Droid adapter. The renderer falls back to the standard model / cost / token pills automatically.

#### Other gaps

- No status events or activity log integration; the terminal panel is the only signal of agent state.
- No trust dialog (`ensureTrust` is a no-op; Droid does not prompt for directory approval).
- No cross-agent handoff source: `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns null because Droid's JSONL transcript format has not yet been wired into the handoff pipeline.

#### Out of scope: post-hoc JSONL replay

Reading `<uuid>.settings.json` after session exit was considered as a "good enough" fallback for cost/token totals. Rejected because (a) the file schema is undocumented and observed to differ across Droid 0.10x point releases, (b) post-hoc data does not solve the live-spinner UX, only the final-row UX, and (c) Factory has signaled willingness to add a streaming channel - see upstream FR.

## Ollama

Ollama drives a local LLM via the `ollama` CLI (https://ollama.com). It is a local-inference tool, not an agentic coder: `ollama run` opens a chat with a local model and cannot edit files or call tools on its own. It is modeled on the Warp adapter (a one-shot run that streams output then exits): `ollama run <model> "<prompt>"` prints the answer and the process exits, so each spawn is a single turn. Free-form multi-turn chat is available by running `ollama run <model>` directly in a Command Terminal.

### CLI Detection

Detection uses the shared `AgentDetector` (via composition, like Aider) with binary name `ollama` and `standardUnixFallbackPaths('ollama')`. `ollama --version` prints `ollama version is X.Y.Z`; `parseVersion` strips the `ollama version is ` prefix.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/ollama/ollama-adapter.ts`

```
ollama run <model> [-- "<prompt>"]
```

- `ollama run` **requires** a model argument (it has no built-in default and no interactive picker), so the adapter always supplies one: the per-column / per-task model override when set, else `DEFAULT_OLLAMA_MODEL` (`llama3.2`). Ollama auto-pulls a missing model on first run, so the fallback is always runnable. The model picker is populated from `ollama list` (see `capability-discovery.ts`); on discovery failure the renderer falls back to a free-form text input.
- The mandatory model argument is a documented exception to `cli-features-over-custom-layers.md` - it is the one Kangentic-managed knob, because `ollama run` cannot run without it.
- The initial prompt is delivered as a single positional argument. The `--` end-of-options guard is pushed first (like Warp) so a prompt starting with `-` (a markdown bullet, a dashed list item) is taken as the positional argument rather than parsed as a flag. On Windows / non-unix shells, embedded double quotes in the prompt are rewritten to single quotes.
- A no-prompt spawn (`ollama run <model>` with no prompt) drops into an interactive REPL the user types into.

### Permission Modes

Ollama has no autonomy / permission concept - it is a plain chat REPL. Per `cli-features-over-custom-layers.md`, the adapter exposes a single informational entry and injects no permission flags in `buildCommand()`.

| Mode | Ollama Behavior |
|------|-----------------|
| `default` | Chat |

`defaultPermission` is `default`.

### Activity Detection

Runtime activity is PTY-only. A one-shot `ollama run` streams output then exits, so the PTY silence timer drives the idle transition. The `detectIdle` callback additionally matches the interactive REPL prompt (`>>> `) for an instant idle when a no-prompt spawn drops into the REPL. `detectFirstOutput` returns true on any non-empty data (no alternate screen buffer).

### Limitations

- No session resume (Ollama has no CLI-level session IDs)
- No hooks, no settings merge, no trust mechanism, no MCP wiring
- No structured status or event output - PTY silence timer (plus the REPL-prompt regex) is the sole idle detection
- No `transcript-cleanup.ts` (streams plain text output, not a TUI alternate screen)
- `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns null - `ollama run` has no native session history files

## Grok Build

`src/main/agent/adapters/grok/`

xAI's terminal coding agent (repo: `xai-org/grok-build`, binary `grok`, a Rust alt-screen
TUI). Grok deliberately clones Claude Code's surface - Claude-compatible hooks, the same
`--session-id` / `--resume` split, the same `--permission-mode` vocabulary - which is what
makes this the second full-harness adapter after Claude. Every empirical claim below was
verified against grok 1.0.0 (3cd0d0cbce) on Windows and is re-checkable with
`node scripts/probe-grok.js` (headless checks spend a few tiny free-tier turns; add
`--skip-pty` to skip the interactive leg).

**Sessions (caller-owned ids).** `-s/--session-id <uuid>` names a NEW session only (reusing
an existing uuid errors with "Session ID ... is already in use"); `--resume <uuid>` resumes.
The store lives at `~/.grok/sessions/<encodeURIComponent(cwd)>/<sessionId>/` (the raw
absolute cwd, backslashes intact on Windows, URL-encoded byte-for-byte) with
`updates.jsonl` (append-only ACP `session/update` JSON-RPC log, the authoritative record),
`chat_history.jsonl` (raw model messages), and `summary.json` (metadata). `GROK_HOME`
overrides `~/.grok`. Because the id is caller-owned, `locate` is a deterministic path build
plus an existence poll, with a sessions-root scan fallback keyed on the uuid for encoding
mismatches. The command builder deliberately emits NO `--cwd`: grok keys the store by
process cwd, and a normalized `--cwd` value could key it under a different encoding than
`session-paths.ts` computes.

**Hooks (the activity pipeline).** Grok fires the full Claude-compatible hook set -
including in headless mode - with camelCase payloads (`toolName`, `toolUseId`, `toolInput`,
`toolResult`, `reason`, `stopHookActive`). `Stop` fires only for the main agent (subagents
fire `SubagentStop` in the subagent), so Claude's subagent-depth gating is unnecessary.
Grok has no per-session settings flag, so the hook file is per-cwd:
`<cwd>/.grok/hooks/kangentic.json`, a wholly-Kangentic-owned file (grok merges every
`*.json` in that directory, so user hook files are never read, merged, or swept). The
per-session events path rides the spawn environment instead of the file: hook commands name
`env:KANGENTIC_EVENTS_PATH`, which `event-bridge.js` resolves from its own process env at
run time - hook processes inherit the grok process env (probe-verified). One static file is
therefore correct for concurrent sessions in one cwd, and a session without the variable
(the user's own manual `grok` run there) makes the bridge a silent no-op. Hooks load from
the project root grok discovers by walking up to the first `.git`; every Kangentic spawn cwd
is a git root, so writing at cwd is writing at the root. Runtime is
`ActivityDetection.hooksAndPty()`: untrusted folders skip project hooks silently
(fail-open), and the PTY silence timer carries activity until trust lands. No `detectIdle`
regex - grok's `❯` prompt stays visible during active work, the same always-visible-prompt
trap as Codex's `›`.

**Telemetry (`updates.jsonl` tail, no statusline).** Grok has no statusline, so
`parseStatus` is null and usage comes from `runtime.sessionHistory` tailing `updates.jsonl`.
Three measured semantics are load-bearing: `params._meta.totalTokens` on streaming/tool
updates is the RUNNING context total (the ContextBar occupancy number);
`turn_completed.usage` is CUMULATIVE across the session (observed `numTurns: 8`,
`inputTokens: 541k` - using it for occupancy is the Codex `total_token_usage` trap; it feeds
`transcriptUsage` instead); and `costUsdTicks` is 1e-10 USD (pinned by a headless json run
reporting `total_cost_usd` and `total_cost_usd_ticks` side by side, re-checked by the
probe). Context window sizes and model display names come from `~/.grok/models_cache.json`.
The parser emits NO tool events - hooks own those, and a second emitter would double-count
ToolStart/ToolEnd pairs - only usage plus idempotent activity hints (`turn_completed` ->
Idle, chunks -> Thinking, non-terminal `retry_state` -> Thinking) as a hook backstop.

**Kangentic MCP.** Project-scoped `<cwd>/.grok/config.toml` carries a sentinel-delimited
`[mcp_servers.kangentic]` block whose every value is an env reference
(`url = "${KANGENTIC_MCP_URL}"`, token header `${KANGENTIC_MCP_TOKEN}`); grok's documented
`${VAR}` expansion resolves them at load time. The block is fully static - the per-session
URL (which carries the caller-session id) and per-launch token ride `buildEnv` - so
concurrent sessions in one cwd each expand their own environment, no secret ever reaches
disk or argv, and removal (refcounted, shared with the hooks file) is a surgical strip of
the sentinel block that never reserializes the user's TOML. The builder also passes
`--allow "MCPTool(kangentic__*)"` (grok's native permission-rules mechanism,
session-scoped, deny still wins) so a board-driven session never stalls on the interactive
approval prompt for Kangentic's own tools - verified live without it,
`kangentic__kangentic_get_current_task` sat on the approval dialog with nobody there to
answer. This is Claude's `mcp__kangentic` allow-rule injection, in grok's dialect.

Both runtime files are hidden from git for the untracked case: the builder seeds
`.grok/hooks/kangentic.json` (unconditionally - the filename is wholly Kangentic-owned),
`.grok/config.toml` (only when Kangentic creates the file; a pre-existing user config keeps
its git visibility), and `.kangentic/` into `.git/info/exclude` via the shared
`git-exclude.ts` mechanism (see the Antigravity section). Neither file carries a secret, so
this is purely untracked-noise control for the Changes pane and `git add -A`.

**Trust.** Folder trust (`~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml`, entries
`[folders.'<path>'] / trusted = true / decided_at = <unix>`) gates project hooks and
project MCP together, and CASCADES to subdirectories - verified live: a Kangentic worktree
under a trusted project root reports `projectTrusted: true` with only the root in the store.
`ensureTrust` therefore pre-approves ONLY a Kangentic worktree with no covering decision
(one entry per task, dropped by `onWorktreeRemoved` - the Codex dead-entries lesson), never
overrules an explicit ancestor deny, and never auto-trusts a plain project root: an
undecided root runs untrusted (PTY fallback carries activity) until the user's own first
interactive grok session decides it once, which then cascades to every future worktree.

**Verification tier: confirm-only.** `chat_history.jsonl` flushes the typed user turn on
SUBMIT (measured 313ms and 32ms across two runs, against a ~2s turn), so a
`command-injection` verifier is wired against it (genuine turns have no `synthetic_reason`
and wrap the text in `<user_query>` tags, which the extractor strips). But records carry no
timestamps to bound the match window and the resolver has never been proven in-app, so
`canEscalateOnVerificationFailure` is false. `canVerifySlashSubmission` is false (slash
input runs in the TUI palette and never becomes a chat_history turn - the Codex verdict),
which is also why `getInjectionSequence` returns `[]` despite grok having native `/model`
and `/effort` commands: an unconfirmable injection could land as literal prompt text, while
the suspend + respawn fallback applies `--model` / `--reasoning-effort` deterministically.

**Other capabilities.** `parseTranscript` reads `chat_history.jsonl`
(`system`/`user`/`assistant`/`reasoning`/`tool_result` records; assistant tool calls in
`tool_calls[]` with JSON-string `arguments`; no timestamps, so entries get a parse-time
stamp and synthesized uuids). `transcriptUsage`/`transcriptToolCounts` read `updates.jsonl`
(Claude-parity lifetime rollup). `summarize` uses the verified headless mode
(`--output-format plain -p`). `probeAuth` runs `grok models` and checks for "not
authenticated" - note grok currently serves a free tier without login, so false means "not
signed in", not "unusable"; a subscription-less account that hits a limit gets an explicit
403 rendered as a failed turn in the TUI, not a hang. Auth is browser OAuth through the PTY
(`grok login`, device-code fallback `--device-auth`, `XAI_API_KEY` env for CI).

**Detector.** `binaryName: 'grok'` with NO `agent` alias - grok's installer also publishes
a generic `agent` shim that collides with Cursor's (see the collision guard below), and
`parseVersion` requires the `grok ` banner prefix so a foreign binary answering on a shared
name is rejected. `tests/unit/cursor-grok-binary-collision.test.ts` pins both directions.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/grok/command-builder.ts`

```
grok [-s <uuid> | --resume <uuid>] --permission-mode <mode> [--allow "MCPTool(kangentic__*)"]
     [--model <slug>] [--reasoning-effort <effort>]
     [-- "<prompt>" | -p "<prompt>" --output-format plain]
```

- `-s <uuid>` names a NEW session and `--resume <uuid>` resumes an existing one; the builder emits exactly one of the two, never both.
- `--permission-mode` is always emitted (see below).
- `--allow "MCPTool(kangentic__*)"` rides along only when the Kangentic MCP server is attached, so a board-driven session never stalls on grok's interactive approval prompt for Kangentic's own tools. An explicit user deny still wins.
- Model and effort overrides pass straight through as `--model <slug>` and `--reasoning-effort <effort>` when set.
- The interactive prompt is delivered after `--` (end-of-options), so prompt text starting with a dash can never be parsed as a CLI option regardless of shell quoting. Non-interactive spawns (`nonInteractive` transition actions) use `-p "<prompt>" --output-format plain` instead, which prints one turn and exits. A resume passes no prompt at all.

### Permission Modes

`--permission-mode` accepts Kangentic's `PermissionMode` names verbatim (verified in
`grok --help`), so all six pass through 1:1. Internally grok normalizes `acceptEdits` and
`dontAsk` onto its own ladder (`default | auto | plan | bypassPermissions`), with `auto` as the
nearest neighbor, so the behavior these names select is grok's, not Claude's.

| Mode | CLI Flag |
|------|----------|
| `plan` | `--permission-mode plan` |
| `default` | `--permission-mode default` |
| `acceptEdits` | `--permission-mode acceptEdits` |
| `auto` | `--permission-mode auto` |
| `dontAsk` | `--permission-mode dontAsk` |
| `bypassPermissions` | `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` |

`defaultPermission` is `acceptEdits`.

## Antigravity

Antigravity CLI (`agy`, https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/getting-started) is Google's terminal TUI coding agent, Gemini-family models by default with optional Claude and open-source backends. It shares the `~/.gemini` home directory with the Gemini CLI but keeps everything of its own under the `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` subtree, with its own trust store, hook schema, and MCP config format - hence a sibling adapter rather than a Gemini variant. Every behavior below was verified against a real agy 1.1.13 install (2026-08-16).

### CLI Detection

Detection uses the shared `AgentDetector` (via composition) with binary name `agy`. The official installer places the binary at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin\agy.exe` on Windows (a fallback path derived from the `LOCALAPPDATA` env var) and `~/.local/bin/agy` on macOS/Linux (covered by `standardUnixFallbackPaths`). `agy --version` prints a bare version number; `parseVersion` requires a leading digit so a foreign tool answering on the same name is rejected.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/antigravity/command-builder.ts`

```
agy [--mode plan|accept-edits] [--dangerously-skip-permissions] [--conversation <id>] [--model <slug>] [--effort <level>] [-i|-p "<prompt>"]
```

- The interactive prompt is delivered via `-i` (`--prompt-interactive`), which runs the prompt and keeps the TUI session; agy has no bare positional prompt form. Non-interactive spawns (`nonInteractive` transition actions) use `-p` instead.
- Resume passes `--conversation <id>` with the captured conversation UUID; it works cross-directory, so a relocated worktree still reaches its conversation. Fresh spawns pass nothing - agy allocates the conversation id lazily at the first turn (`supportsCallerSessionId` is false).
- Model (`--model <slug>`) and effort (`--effort low|medium|high`) overrides pass straight through when set.
- As spawn side effects the builder merges the Kangentic named hook into `<cwd>/.agents/hooks.json` and writes the MCP workspace plugin (below).

### Permission Modes

Mapped onto agy's native autonomy flags; the unflagged default is agy's own "request-review" mode.

| Mode | agy flag |
|------|----------|
| `plan` | `--mode plan` |
| `default` | (none - request-review) |
| `acceptEdits` / `auto` | `--mode accept-edits` |
| `bypassPermissions` / `dontAsk` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |

`defaultPermission` is `acceptEdits`.

### Hooks and Activity Detection

agy has a lifecycle hook system (`hooks.json` in a customization root; the adapter writes `<cwd>/.agents/hooks.json` with one named hook, `kangentic-events`). Three events feed the event-bridge pipeline: `PreInvocation` -> `prompt` (the turn-initiating signal, also carrying a `captureHookContext` directive so the session id can be read from the payload), `PostToolUse` -> `tool_end` (tool name at `toolCall.name`, primary argument from `toolCall.args`, via the path-addressed `extractToolPath` / `extractDetailPath` directives), and `Stop` -> `idle` (agy's payload carries `fullyIdle`). `PreToolUse` is deliberately NEVER hooked: agy treats a handler response without a `decision` field as a DENY (observed: a `{}` response put the model in a tool-denied retry loop), and answering `allow` would bypass the CLI's own permission system.

Two agy quirks shape the wiring. First, agy tokenizes hook commands on whitespace with quote characters kept literal, so no command token may be quoted or contain a space: every path is emitted `.agents`-relative (hooks run with cwd = the directory containing hooks.json) and the event-bridge is copied to `<cwd>/.kangentic/agy-event-bridge.cjs` on each spawn (`.cjs` so a `"type": "module"` in the user's package.json cannot make node parse the CommonJS bridge as ESM). Second, hooks do NOT fire in `-p` print mode, so activity is `hooks_and_pty`: hook events are primary, and the PTY silence timer plus a `detectIdle` match on the idle footer (`? for shortcuts`; the running footer shows `esc to cancel` instead) cover print-mode spawns and any workspace where hook wiring was skipped.

Session ids are captured two ways: `fromHook` reads `conversationId` (present in every hook payload, camelCase protojson), and `fromOutput` matches the graceful-shutdown summary (`agy --conversation=<uuid>`) plus print-mode JSON (`"conversation_id"`). There is no `fromFilesystem` capture: `cache/last_conversations.json` is written only at CLI exit, after the spawn-time polling window has closed.

### MCP

The Kangentic MCP server is registered as a WORKSPACE PLUGIN at `<cwd>/.agents/plugins/kangentic/` (`plugin.json` marker + `mcp_config.json` with `serverUrl` and a `headers['X-Kangentic-Token']` entry). agy dials `serverUrl` with streamable HTTP (`POST /mcp`) and forwards the headers map, connecting lazily at the first agent turn. A bare workspace `mcp_config.json` (no plugin wrapper) does not load (upstream google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#60). Same plaintext-token trade-off as Gemini: the per-launch token sits on disk during the active session; tokens rotate per app launch and `removeHooks()` deletes the plugin dir on session exit / suspend.

The runtime files are also hidden from git for the session's lifetime: the command builder seeds `.git/info/exclude` (the local, never-committed ignore file, resolved through the worktree's `commondir` so one seeding covers every worktree of the repo) with `.agents/plugins/kangentic/`, `.kangentic/`, and - only when Kangentic created the file itself - `.agents/hooks.json`. Ignore rules affect untracked files only, so a user's own tracked `.agents` customizations keep normal git visibility, while the token-bearing plugin can never ride into a commit on a `git add -A`. The marker comment in the exclude file says the lines are safe to remove. This mechanism originated here and now lives in `src/main/agent/shared/git-exclude.ts` (generic `# kangentic:` marker; the legacy antigravity-branded marker is recognized by prefix so already-seeded repos never gain a second marker block), shared by the Gemini, Qwen, Droid, and Grok builders and OpenCode's plugin install - each with its own pattern list and created-by-us carve-outs.

### Trust

agy stores workspace trust as `trustedWorkspaces: string[]` (exact absolute paths) in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` - NOT Gemini's `trustedFolders.json`, and with no per-entry trust level. Trust is exact-path, not inherited: agy prompts for a task worktree even when the repository root above it is already trusted (observed live), so `ensureTrust` writes one entry per spawn cwd rather than relying on ancestor coverage, and the TUI's workspace trust confirmation never blocks an automated spawn. `onWorktreeRemoved` drops the exact-path entry so the list does not grow one dead entry per task, and `onProjectRelocated` re-keys both the trust entry and the `last_conversations.json` mapping.

### Session History and Transcript

Each conversation writes a parseable JSONL transcript at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<conversationId>/.system_generated/logs/transcript.jsonl` (steps: `USER_INPUT` with the prompt wrapped in `<USER_REQUEST>`, `PLANNER_RESPONSE` with `thinking` / `content` / `tool_calls`, `ERROR_MESSAGE`, `CHECKPOINT`). `parseTranscript` maps it into `TranscriptEntry[]` and `transcriptToolCounts` counts its tool calls. The conversation store itself (`conversations/<uuid>.db`) is SQLite with opaque protobuf step payloads and is not read.

The transcript flushes ON SUBMIT (measured: 84ms worst append latency across short and long turns), which is what qualifies the command-injection verifier - see [command-injection.md](command-injection.md).

### Limitations

- No token/context/cost telemetry: neither the interactive transcript nor the hook payloads carry usage, so the adapter declares `liveTelemetryUnsupported` ("Telemetry: TUI only" - the agy footer shows the active model and effort). The board model pill is seeded from a `--model` override via `configuredModelFromCommand`.
- No live model/effort injection: `/model` exists in the TUI but model changes restart by design, and no `/effort` slash command exists, so `getInjectionSequence` is omitted.
- No `probeAuth` / `loginCommand`: sign-in is keyring + Google Sign-In completed inside the TUI (works through the PTY); there is no login subcommand and no reliable non-quota probe.
- Slash auto_commands are `verify: 'none'`: the TUI rejects an unregistered `/command` client-side ("Unknown command") and records nothing (`canVerifySlashSubmission` is false).
- Handoff transcript cleanup captures the last turn only (no response marker glyph; same limitation as Gemini).

## Goose CLI

Goose is Block's open-source agent CLI (`goose`, https://github.com/aaif-goose/goose). It is a thin first-pass integration, close to the Warp/Ollama adapters: no hooks wired, no structured status/event output, no trust mechanism, and no settings merging. It differs from those two by supporting session resume and by delivering its approval mode through an env var.

"No hooks wired" rather than "no hooks", and the distinction is load-bearing because it is what justifies the PTY-only activity detection below. Goose ships a hook system: plugin-scoped `hooks/hooks.json` discovered from `<project>/.agents/plugins/<name>/` or `~/.agents/plugins/<name>/`, firing `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PreToolUseResult`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `BeforeReadFile`, `AfterFileEdit`, `BeforeShellExecution`, and `AfterShellExecution`, each handed a JSON payload on stdin carrying `event` and `session_id`. That is the same `.agents/` workspace shape the Antigravity adapter already writes to and a payload close to what `event-bridge.js` consumes, so wiring hooks (and with them structured activity, a session-id capture, and eventually a submission verifier) is a follow-up rather than a blocked path. Until then activity rides the PTY silence timer, with the false-idle exposure that implies.

### CLI Detection

Detection uses the shared `AgentDetector` (via composition) with binary name `goose` and `standardUnixFallbackPaths('goose')`. The official installer puts the binary in `~/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux (covered by those fallbacks) and in `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows, where it is added to PATH and found by `which`.

`parseVersion` REQUIRES a digit immediately after the product name (`goose` or `goose-cli`, optional `v`, case-insensitive). This is a collision defense, not cosmetic: two other tools install a binary called `goose` - pressly/goose, a widely used Go database-migration tool (banner `goose version: v3.24.1`), and the awesome-goose scaffolding framework (banner `goose version 0.0.0`). A scan-anywhere `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` match accepts both and reports them as Block's agent CLI, after which Kangentic spawns `goose run -t "<prompt>" -s` against a tool that has no such command. Both impostors put the literal word `version` where Block's clap-generated banner puts the digits, which is the discriminator. `AgentDetector` walks every `which` match in order, so rejecting a foreign banner means detection skips that binary and keeps looking rather than stopping on the wrong one. Same anchoring as `GrokDetector`, for the same reason.

The accept side is deliberately wider than one pinned string, because Goose's published docs show the `--version` command everywhere and its stdout nowhere. A false negative surfaces as a diagnosable "not found" with the raw line logged by `AgentDetector`; a false positive spawns the wrong binary.

### Command Building

`src/main/agent/adapters/goose/goose-adapter.ts`

```
goose run [-r] [-n <sessionId>] -t "<prompt>" -s    # with a prompt
goose run [-r] [-n <sessionId>] -t "<prompt>"       # nonInteractive spawn_agent action
goose session [-r] [-n <sessionId>]                 # promptless / resume
```

- Goose runs in the process cwd (there is no start-in-dir flag), so the PTY's cwd set by the spawn chokepoint is authoritative and no directory flag is passed.
- A prompt uses `goose run -t "<prompt>" -s`: process the prompt, then stay interactive (`-s` / `--interactive`) so the user can continue the session. A promptless spawn opens a bare interactive `goose session`.
- A `nonInteractive` spawn_agent action drops `-s`, which is already Goose's headless one-shot form: run the prompt and exit. Leaving `-s` on would park a fire-and-forget automation in a session that never exits.
- `-n <sessionId>` names the session with the engine-generated id when one is present; `-r` is added to resume that named session. On Windows / non-unix shells, embedded double quotes in the prompt are rewritten to single quotes.

### Session Resume

`supportsCallerSessionId` is `true`. Goose accepts a caller-supplied session name (`--name`), so the engine hands it the id it generated on the fresh spawn and resumes with `-r -n <id>`. No transcript parsing is needed to capture an id after the fact, so `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns null.

### Permission Modes

Goose sets its approval mode through the `GOOSE_MODE` env var, not a spawn flag, so the permission dropdown is delivered via `buildEnv`. The mapping lives in `GOOSE_MODE_BY_PERMISSION`, a `Record` over the full `PermissionMode` union (so a new mode is a compile error rather than a silent wrong-mode spawn), and it maps all six modes below. The dropdown exposes three, one per distinct Goose mode Kangentic can reach; `dontAsk`, `acceptEdits`, and `auto` are not offered there but are still mapped, so a column/lane override or the global default that forces one of them resolves to a valid `GOOSE_MODE`.

Goose has four modes. `approve` (every action needs approval) is stricter than `smart_approve`, so it sits below `default` on the permissiveness ladder the dropdown is ordered by and nothing maps to it.

| Mode | GOOSE_MODE | Goose Behavior |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `plan` | `chat` | No tools at all. Not merely read-only: the agent cannot read files either, so a plan-mode Goose session reasons without repo access |
| `dontAsk` | `chat` | No tools (not in the dropdown). Goose has no allowlist, so "deny unless allowed" degrades to "deny" |
| `default` | `smart_approve` | File modifications need approval, reads do not |
| `acceptEdits` | `smart_approve` | Not in the dropdown. See below |
| `auto` | `auto` | Modify/create/delete and run shell commands without approval (not in the dropdown) |
| `bypassPermissions` | `auto` | Same as above. The explicit opt-in to full autonomy |

`acceptEdits` is the mode with no faithful target. Everywhere else in Kangentic it means "auto-approve edits, still gate shell commands", and Goose has no such mode: the only way to stop prompting on edits is `auto`, which also stops prompting on shell. It therefore resolves DOWN to `smart_approve` rather than up to `auto`, and this matters more than it looks: `DEFAULT_CONFIG.agent.permissionMode` is `acceptEdits` and `resolveEffectivePermissionMode` falls through task -> lane -> that global without consulting the adapter's `permissions` list, so whatever `acceptEdits` maps to is the out-of-the-box spawn for every Goose session on a fresh install. Mapping it to `auto` made that a fully unattended agent nobody chose. The practical consequence of resolving down is that a Goose agent on default settings prompts on file writes; choose "Auto (Skip All Approvals)" for unattended board runs.

`defaultPermission` is `default`. Model/provider selection is left to Goose's own `--model`/`--provider` flags and `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`; per `cli-features-over-custom-layers.md` the adapter keeps no model list and does not shadow the CLI's model control.

### Activity Detection

Runtime activity is PTY-only. The silence timer drives the idle transition; `detectFirstOutput` returns true on any non-empty data (no alternate screen buffer). There is no hook or status pipeline.

### Limitations

Every item here is "not wired in this adapter", not "the CLI cannot do it", except where noted.

- No hook plugin installed, so no structured status or event output: the PTY silence timer is the sole idle detection, with the false-idle exposure that implies. Goose's hook system (see above) is the obvious way to close this.
- No MCP wiring, so a Goose session cannot call the `kangentic_*` tools. Goose supports MCP extensions natively (`--with-extension`, `--with-streamable-http-extension <url>`), so this is a follow-up too.
- No settings merge and no trust mechanism (Goose genuinely has no folder-trust gate).
- No transcript parsing or capability discovery, and no `summarize` (auto-name not yet wired).
- `locateSessionHistoryFile` returns null - resume rides on the caller-supplied `--name` instead.
- `plan` mode maps to Goose `chat`, which has no file access at all, so a plan-mode Goose session cannot read the repo it is planning against.

## Project relocation

A Kangentic project relocates in one of two ways, both handled by the `project:relocate` IPC
handler (`src/main/ipc/handlers/project-relocate.ts`): the user moves the folder outside
Kangentic and points us at the new location (`repoint` mode, reached from Project Settings or the
Locate Folder dialog), or Kangentic moves the folder itself in one step (`move` mode, reached
from the Project Settings "Move..." button). In both modes the handler suspends the project's own
live sessions, then rewrites the stored DB paths, then calls the optional
`onProjectRelocated(oldPath, newPath)` hook on every registered adapter (best-effort, per-adapter
try/catch). By the time the hook fires the folder is already at `newPath`. Each adapter migrates
the per-project data its CLI keys to the absolute path OUTSIDE the project folder, so sessions
stay resumable. The shared mechanics (path-pair collection across the project root plus on-disk
worktrees, directory rename/merge, backup + atomic write, serial lock) live in
`src/main/agent/shared/relocation-utils.ts`; per-adapter logic lives in each adapter's
`project-relocation.ts`.

Suspending the project's own sessions fully terminates their PTYs before the folder moves (the
quiesce that lets the move succeed on Windows, where a directory cannot be renamed while a
process holds a handle inside it). It does NOT cover an unrelated agent session running in a
DIFFERENT project or an external terminal: such a session can still hold a shared global config
(e.g. `~/.claude.json`) in memory and overwrite the migrated keys on its next save. Kangentic
only manages its own sessions and does not detect or kill those, so that residue is accepted (the
same caveat the Claude adapter documents).

| Agent | What migrates | Documented residue / notes |
|-------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Claude | `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/` transcript dirs and `~/.claude.json` `projects` keys (backup `~/.claude.json.kangentic-backup`). | - |
| Qwen Code | `~/.qwen/projects/<slug>/` chats, `~/.qwen/tmp/<sha256>/` history, and `~/.qwen/trustedFolders.json` keys. | - |
| Droid | `~/.factory/sessions/<cwd-slug>/` session dirs. | Best-effort: Droid is closed source, so resume resolution around the slug dir is not authoritatively documented. |
| OpenCode | `session.directory`/`session.path`, `project.worktree`, `project_directory.directory` columns in `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (one transaction). | No file backup (live WAL DB; rollback = status quo). `project.sandboxes` left untouched. Project id is git-derived, so sessions are never orphaned, only re-scoped. |
| Gemini | `~/.gemini/projects.json` key, `.project_root` markers under `tmp/`+`history/<slug>/`, and `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` keys; slug dirs renamed opportunistically on a basename change. | When the new-basename slug is already taken, the old slug is kept (Gemini still resolves via the registry, but Kangentic's basename-keyed chat locator cannot find the old chats - a pre-existing Gemini basename-collision limitation). |
| Codex | `[projects.'<path>']` trust headers in `~/.codex/config.toml` (line-based, preserving quote / `\\?\` prefix / separator style). | Rollout JSONLs under `~/.codex/sessions/` are intentionally NOT touched: `codex resume <id>` resolves by session id, so resume already survives a move. Only the cwd-filtered resume picker shows residue (it has an `--all` escape hatch). |
| Kimi | `~/.kimi/sessions/<md5(work_dir)>/` dirs (and `<kaos>_<md5>` variants) and `~/.kimi/kimi.json` `work_dirs[].path`. | md5 is computed over the resolved native-separator path (Kangentic spawns Kimi with a forward-slashed `-w`, but Kimi normalizes to native before hashing). |
| Copilot | `cwd` / `git_root` lines in `~/.copilot/session-state/<uuid>/workspace.yaml`. | Best-effort and version-fragile (v1.0.52+ resumes in the saved cwd). The `~/.copilot/session-store.db` cache is left untouched, so picker/search residue is accepted. |
| Aider | None. | History (`.aider.chat.history.md`) lives inside the project folder and moves with it. |
| Cursor | None. | No cwd-keyed external session store Kangentic depends on. |
| Oz (Warp) | None. | No resumable on-disk session state. |
| Ollama | None. | No resumable external session state; `onProjectRelocated` omitted. |
| Grok Build | `~/.grok/sessions/<encodeURIComponent(cwd)>/` session dirs and `[folders.'<path>']` headers in `~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml`. | Encoded-dir rename mirrors Droid's slug rename; the trust rewrite mirrors Codex's header rewrite (backup + atomic write). |
| Antigravity | `trustedWorkspaces` entries in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` and the workspace key in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cache/last_conversations.json`. | Conversation data (`conversations/<uuid>.db`, `brain/<uuid>/`) is keyed by conversation id, not path, and Kangentic resumes by explicit `--conversation <id>` (cross-directory), so only trust and the user's own `agy -c` continuity need migrating. |
| Goose | None. | Resume rides on the caller-supplied `--name` (cwd-independent), so no path-keyed state needs migrating; `onProjectRelocated` omitted. |

## Prompt Templates

Actions of type `spawn_agent` can define a `promptTemplate` with `{{placeholder}}` variables. The full variable set (`task_xml`, `title`, `description`, `taskId`, `projectPath`, `worktreePath`, `branchName`, `baseBranch`, `prUrl`, `prNumber`, `attachments`, `port`) is documented once, in the transition engine's [Template Variables](transition-engine.md#template-variables) section. The two families worth calling out for prompt authoring:

- `{{task_xml}}` is the preferred default: a `<task><title>...</title><description>...</description></task>` envelope (escaped).
- `{{title}}` / `{{description}}` remain for backward compatibility with custom prose templates.

Default template: `{{task_xml}}{{attachments}}`

The `<task>` envelope follows Anthropic + OpenAI guidance: wrap user-authored input in XML tags so the model has a clear data/instruction boundary. Non-XML-aware agents (Aider, Codex) treat the markup as harmless prose. Attachment `@-mention` paths stay outside the envelope so Claude Code / Gemini bare-token parsers reliably auto-inject them.

A typical prompt:

```
<task>
  <title>Fix auth bug</title>
  <description>Users can't login after password reset</description>
</task>
/path/to/screenshot.png
```

Shortcut commands use a separate set of template variables. See [Configuration](configuration.md#shortcuts) for the full list.

## Bridge Scripts

Two standalone Node.js scripts in `src/main/agent/`:

### `status-bridge.js`

- **Hook point:** `statusLine` (not a hook - uses Claude Code's status line feature)
- **Output:** `status.json` (overwritten on each invocation)
- **Data:** Token usage, cost, model, context window percentage
- **Watched by:** SessionManager with 100ms debounce
- **Supported by:** Claude Code, Gemini CLI (via status parser)

### `event-bridge.js`

- **Hook point:** All registered hooks
- **Output:** `events.jsonl` (append-only, one JSON line per event)
- **Data:** Timestamps, event types, tool names, file paths
- **Watched by:** SessionManager with 50ms debounce, incremental byte-offset reads
- **Supported by:** Claude Code (18 hook points), Codex CLI (via config.toml hooks), Gemini CLI (via .gemini/settings.json hooks), Qwen Code, Aider, GitHub Copilot CLI, Grok Build (via `.grok/hooks/kangentic.json`, with the events path resolved through the `env:KANGENTIC_EVENTS_PATH` sentinel - see [Grok Build](#grok-build)), and Antigravity CLI (via a per-spawn workspace copy, `<cwd>/.kangentic/agy-event-bridge.cjs` - see [Antigravity](#antigravity))

Both scripts are stateless (no persistent process), read JSON from stdin, write to their output file, and exit. All writes are try/catch wrapped for non-fatal failures.

## CWD Strategy

All agent CLIs are invoked with `cwd` set to:
- **Worktree path** if the task has a worktree
- **Project directory** otherwise

This ensures agents load project-level configuration (`.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) from the correct location.
