# Database Architecture

## Two-Database Architecture

Kangentic uses a two-database design:

- **Global DB** (`<configDir>/index.db`) -- stores the project list, global configuration, and dev-server port reservations.
- **Per-project DB** (`<configDir>/projects/<projectId>.db`) -- stores tasks, swimlanes, actions, and sessions for a single project.

This separation keeps project data isolated. Deleting a project removes only its database file.

## Database Locations

The config directory is platform-dependent:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/kangentic/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/kangentic/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kangentic/` (defaults to `~/.config/kangentic/`) |

Overridable via the `KANGENTIC_DATA_DIR` environment variable. When set, all database files are stored under that directory instead of the platform default.

## Configuration

All database connections are opened with three pragmas, in this order:

- `busy_timeout = 5000` -- wait up to 5 seconds on locked databases before returning SQLITE_BUSY
- `journal_mode = WAL` -- concurrent reads without blocking writers
- `foreign_keys = ON` -- enforce referential integrity on all foreign key constraints

The order matters. `busy_timeout` is a connection setting that covers only the statements after
it, and `journal_mode = WAL` takes a lock: it creates the `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars. Setting the
timeout second would leave the WAL switch, the one statement most likely to collide, with no retry
window at all.

All queries are synchronous via **better-sqlite3** -- they block the Node.js event loop briefly but avoid callback complexity.

A connection is published to its module cache only after the pragmas and migrations have both
succeeded. On failure the half-built handle is closed and the error is rethrown, so a retry
reopens rather than reusing a connection that never ran migrations. `resetGlobalDb()` drops the
cached global connection deliberately, which is what the Retry button below reopens through.

## When the global database cannot be read

`SQLITE_IOERR`, `SQLITE_READONLY`, and `SQLITE_BUSY` on `index.db` are environmental: an antivirus
scan, a OneDrive or Dropbox sync lock, a read-only or full volume, or failing storage. There is
nothing to fix in the query, so the policy is to say so rather than to retry silently or fail
opaquely.

**At startup.** `ensureGlobalDbReadable()` (`src/main/db/global-db-dialog.ts`) opens the database
early in the `app.whenReady()` body, before the MCP server starts and before any window exists. A
failure shows a modal naming the resolved file path, the SQLite code (or the plain error message
when the failure carries no `SQLITE_*` code, such as a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch), and the
likely causes, with Retry and Quit. Retry drops the cached connection and reopens; a lock is usually over within
seconds, so this recovers without a relaunch. Quit counts an `app_error` and calls `app.exit(0)`,
which is correct rather than `app.quit()` because `registerAllIpc` has not run yet and
`performShutdown` would throw reaching for a board config manager that does not exist. Under
`NODE_ENV=test` the dialog is skipped so the E2E tier never hangs on a modal nobody can click.

**While running.** Global-database reads go through `softly()` (`src/main/db/soft-db.ts`), which
returns a fallback instead of throwing and logs once per operation. Four operations are softened:
`project:list`, `projectGroup:list` and `project:getCurrent` in
`src/main/ipc/handlers/projects.ts`, plus `lastOpenedProject`, which is read at two call sites
inside `createWindow()`: once to resolve the boot project path, and again inside the
`preloadPromise` catch block when that path turns out to be missing. Neither is an IPC handler,
and the first is the first global-database touch on the whole boot path, which is exactly where
DESKTOP-9 threw. Both share the one operation name, so a failure at either logs once for the pair.

Only the two list reads raise the dialog, once per incident: a successful Retry re-arms it, so a
later outage can still speak. `project:getCurrent` does not, because `project:list` already speaks
for the pair and it answers null on the cold-boot path anyway.

`createWindow()` is additionally wrapped in `try`/`finally`, because the `lastOpenedProject` read
sits below its own `loadURL` call. A throw there used to skip `initUpdater`, `initAnnouncements`
and `markStartupComplete`, leaving a live renderer invoking `announcements:get` with nobody
listening (Sentry DESKTOP-3/4, the Windows event). Softening the read and making the block
throw-proof are two layers against the same failure, not separate concerns.

Writes are never softened: a mutation that swallows its failure reports a success that did not
happen (see `.claude/rules/project-scoped-ipc.md`).

Advisory tables opt out of the notification. The dev-port lease ledger degrades on every unit-tier
CI run by design, so it passes `level: 'warn'` and no `notify`; wiring the dialog into the
combinator itself would show it to production users and consume the one notification the project
list needs.

## Global DB Schema

### projects table

|--------|------|-------------|---------|

### global_config table

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|------|-------------|
| key | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY |
| value | TEXT | NOT NULL |

### dev_ports table

Dev-server port reservations. GLOBAL rather than per-project by necessity, not
by policy: ports are a machine-wide resource, so two projects both defaulting to
5173 is exactly the collision a per-project table could not see.

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|------|-------------|
| port | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY |
| project_id | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| task_id | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| allocated_at | TEXT | NOT NULL |

Indexes: `idx_dev_ports_project` on `project_id`, and `idx_dev_ports_task` on
`task_id`. The `task_id` index is deliberately **NOT unique** -- a task may hold
several ports (an API, a frontend, a mock server), reserved together so a
sibling task cannot be handed one in between. `port` stays the primary key, so a
PORT still cannot be held twice.

A row is ADVISORY, never authoritative: whether a port is actually usable is
answered by a bind-and-connect probe (`src/main/dev-ports/dev-port-allocator.ts`),
which is what lets a stale reservation self-correct instead of permanently
burning a port. Rows are released when the task is deleted
(`TaskRepository.delete`) or its project is removed (`ProjectRepository.delete`);
there is no background reclaim.

## Per-Project DB Schema

### swimlanes table

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| name | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| role | TEXT | | NULL |
| position | INTEGER | NOT NULL | |
| color | TEXT | NOT NULL | '#3b82f6' |
| icon | TEXT | | NULL |
| is_archived | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| permission_mode | TEXT | | NULL |
| auto_spawn | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 1 |
| auto_command | TEXT | | NULL (retired) |
| auto_command_mode | TEXT | NOT NULL | 'immediate' (retired) |
| plan_exit_target_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| is_ghost | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| agent_override | TEXT | | NULL |
| model_override | TEXT | | NULL |
| effort_override | TEXT | | NULL |
| handoff_context | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| session_target | TEXT | NOT NULL | 'main' |
| session_spawn_strategy | TEXT | NOT NULL | 'create_or_resume' |
| created_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| description | TEXT | | NULL |

Valid role values: `todo`, `done`, or NULL (custom column). The column has no CHECK constraint, and
roles that have since left the union (`planning`, `running`, `backlog`) genuinely shipped, so the
value is never trusted on the way in or out: `applyBoardConfigToDb` normalizes a role arriving from
`kangentic.json`, `SwimlaneRepository.mapRow` narrows on read via `normalizeSwimlaneRole`, and an
unconditional migration clears any stray value already on disk (migration 59). `role` is write-once
at create and is deliberately absent from `SwimlaneUpdateInput`.

`auto_command` and `auto_command_mode` are RETIRED. The column's message to its agent is a
`send_message` row in `column_automations` now; the automations migration moved every non-empty
value into one, nulled the first field and reset the second, and nothing reads either any more.
They are left in place so an older build can still open the database. The per-TASK `auto_command`
on `tasks` is unaffected and still MCP-only.

Per-column session model (two orthogonal axes; see `src/shared/types.ts` and `docs/session-lifecycle.md` "Isolated Sessions"):
- `session_target` (renamed from the original `session_strategy`): `main` (default, the task's main session) or `isolated` (a separate, context-isolated session keyed by the swimlane id). See `SessionTarget`.
- `session_spawn_strategy`: `create_or_resume` (default, resume the target track's session or spawn one) or `always_spawn_new` (always spawn fresh on entry, retiring the prior session for that `(task, target)`). See `SessionSpawnStrategy`. The fresh-vs-resume pairing with `session_target` is applied by the writers, not by `resolveForceFresh`: this column is `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'create_or_resume'` and `SwimlaneRepository.create` writes a concrete string, so the resolver's context-aware fallback never evaluates for a stored row. The two INTERACTIVE writers, the Column Manager and the MCP `create_column` / `update_column` handlers, route through `snapSpawnStrategyToTarget`, which moves this to `always_spawn_new` when a column becomes `isolated` and back when it returns to `main`, in both cases only while it still sits at the outgoing track's default. The `kangentic.json` sync is the exception: `apply-config.ts` applies each key exactly as the file gives it, with no pairing. That is harmless for a file the app wrote, since `build-config.ts` emits both keys whenever either is non-default, but a HAND-EDITED `kangentic.json` naming only `sessionTarget: isolated` applies as `isolated` + `create_or_resume`, which resumes one long review instead of running a fresh pass per entry. Spell both keys out when editing that file by hand.

### tasks table

| detail_view_state | TEXT | | NULL |

| updated_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

Indexes: `idx_tasks_swimlane_position` on (swimlane_id, position), `idx_tasks_display_id` on (display_id) UNIQUE, `idx_tasks_session_id` on (session_id), `idx_tasks_external` on (external_source, external_id).

`worktree_folder` is the DIRECTORY NAME of the task's worktree, written once and never rewritten
(`TaskRepository.setWorktreeFolder` guards on `worktree_folder IS NULL`). New tasks get
`String(display_id)`; tasks predating that scheme keep their legacy `<slug>-<taskId8>` name. Whenever
`worktree_path` is non-null, `basename(worktree_path)` equals it. See
[Worktree Strategy](worktree-strategy.md#worktree-directory-naming) for why the name has to be
stored rather than recomputed.

`worktree_skip_reason` records WHY the task's last spawn ran without a worktree, i.e. in the shared
project checkout: one of `'disabled' | 'not-a-repo' | 'nested-worktree' | 'no-commits' |
'remote-agent' | 'worktree-missing'` (the `WorktreeSkipReason` union), or NULL while the task has a
worktree or no spawn has decided yet. Written only by `TaskRepository.setWorktreeSkipReason` (spawn
telemetry, so no `updated_at` bump) and cleared by `recordWorktree`, a To Do reset, and a Done move;
the generic `update()` never touches it. It is the ground truth for any surface that wants to say
"running in the checkout the app runs from" rather than infer it from a null `worktree_path`, but
today it is recorded and exposed with no renderer reader: the 12px card glyph that drew it was
reviewed out as too small to tell apart. The task card's marker and the detail header's "Project
folder" chip still read `worktree_path`.
See [Worktree Strategy](worktree-strategy.md#when-a-worktree-is-not-created).

`profile_id` names a Board Profile - a team-shared, named alternate set of per-column strategy
settings the task rides as it moves (see [Configuration > Board Profiles](configuration.md#board-profiles)).
There is deliberately **no foreign key**: profile *definitions* live in `kangentic.json`, not this
database, so the profile is team-shared while the assignment stays per-machine runtime state. NULL
means "Default" - every column uses its own settings - and Default is synthetic: there is no stored
Default profile, so a board that has never used the feature needs no migration or backfill. An id
pointing at a profile a teammate deleted degrades to Default and logs once, rather than wedging the
task.

`run_mode` records which of the New Task / Edit dialog's two branches the user chose:
`'column_settings'` (follow each column as the task moves; `profile_id` selects which set of column
settings applies) or `'agent_override'` (pin agent/model/effort/permission for the task's whole
life). It is stored rather than derived from "does the task carry a pin", because Agent Override with
all four fields left on inherit writes exactly the same nulls as Column Settings while meaning the
opposite - the first locks all four on first spawn or on leaving To Do, the second never locks.
Deriving it silently dropped that choice on every save. The migration backfills `'agent_override'`
for any row that
already carries one of the four pins **and** has a NULL `profile_id`, reproducing the old derivation
exactly, so upgraded boards behave identically. The `profile_id IS NULL` clause is belt-and-braces -
a profile task cannot carry a pin, so it changes no row today - but it makes the backfill correct by
construction rather than by trusting an invariant enforced in another file.

`profile_id`, `run_mode`, and the four Advanced pins (`agent_override`, `model_override`,
`effort_override`, `permission_mode`) are **mutually exclusive**, enforced at write time in
`TaskRepository` (`applyProfileExclusivity`): setting the profile nulls all four pins and forces
`run_mode = 'column_settings'`; setting any of the four (or asking for `'agent_override'` directly)
nulls the profile and sets `run_mode = 'agent_override'`. That exclusivity is what keeps
`lockAdvancedOverridesOnFirstSpawn` correct - a profile task is never in override mode, so the
lock never fires for it. `auto_command` is deliberately **not** in the exclusivity set:
it is an MCP-only escape hatch, so a task may carry both a profile and its own auto-command, and it
never implies override mode.

### schema_meta table

Key/value flags for data migrations that cannot answer "have I run" from the data itself.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| key | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| value | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

One key so far, written by the automations migration. That migration is one-way and deliberately
leaves its source rows in `actions` and `swimlane_transitions` for an older build to read, so the
presence of converted rows proves nothing: a board could legitimately have automations and no
transitions, or both.

Distinct from `project_meta`, which holds live per-project state (the `display_id` high-water
mark) rather than migration bookkeeping.

### column_automations table

What a column does when a task enters or leaves it. Replaces the `actions` + `swimlane_transitions`
pair, which modelled a shared action referenced by N transitions; an automation belongs to exactly
one column.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| swimlane_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, FK->swimlanes ON DELETE CASCADE | |
| name | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| type | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| trigger | TEXT | NOT NULL | 'enter' |
| position | INTEGER | NOT NULL | |
| enabled | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 1 |
| config_json | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| created_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| updated_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

Valid types: `send_message`, `run_script`, `webhook`, `notify`, plus legacy `spawn_agent` on boards
that already had one. `trigger` is `enter` or `exit`. It is TEXT rather than a boolean `on_exit`
deliberately, so a third trigger (an agent going idle, a PR merging) is a new value rather than a
migration.

`position` is assigned PER TRIGGER, so each group numbers from 0 independently and the two can
never interleave.

The foreign key is genuine and enforced (`database.ts` sets `foreign_keys = ON`). The one on
`swimlane_transitions.from_swimlane_id` had to be dropped for its `'*'` wildcard; this table has no
wildcard. `SwimlaneRepository.delete` also cascades explicitly, rather than relying on a pragma
being set.

Indices:

- `idx_column_automations_lookup` on (swimlane_id, trigger, position) - the read the engine does on
  every move.
- `idx_column_automations_name` UNIQUE on (swimlane_id, name COLLATE NOCASE) - what makes per-column
  name uniqueness TRUE rather than merely validated in the editor, so a hand-edited `kangentic.json`
  or an MCP write cannot break it. `COLLATE NOCASE` folds ASCII only while the editor's
  `toLowerCase()` folds Unicode, so the editor rejects a superset, which is the safe direction. The
  migration dedupes names BEFORE creating this index, or it fails.

### automation_runs table

One row per execution, written `running` before the attempt and closed on every exit path. This is
the durable record; the failure toast is the rationed interruption, following
`auto-command-outcome.ts`.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| automation_id | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| automation_name | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| type | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| task_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, FK->tasks ON DELETE CASCADE | |
| swimlane_id | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| trigger | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| status | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| detail | TEXT | | |
| attempts | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| started_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| finished_at | TEXT | | |

`status` is `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `skipped`, or `interrupted`. `detail` carries the skip
reason, the error, or a one-line success (`HTTP 204`, `exit 0`).

`automation_name` and `type` are DENORMALIZED and there is no foreign key to `column_automations`:
a run log that empties itself when you rename or delete the automation is not a log.

Two indices, one per question the log is asked:

| Index | Columns | Serves |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `idx_automation_runs_task` | (task_id, started_at DESC) | A task's own run history, newest first (`automation:runsForTask`) |
| `idx_automation_runs_automation` | (automation_id, started_at DESC) | Runs by automation, newest first, for the MCP run history tool's per-automation listing (`listForAutomation`) |

**Project-open sweep.** In the same pass that runs `retryFailedDoneCleanups`, two things happen.
`markStaleRunsInterrupted(startedBefore)` stamps every row still `running` as `interrupted`, and
`pruneTo(200)` keeps the newest 200 rows per project, because nothing else bounds the table. The
sweep is required for honesty: `synchronous-shutdown.md` forbids awaiting a drain on quit, so a
`running` row at boot is a known orphan, and without this "these always run" is false on every
restart.

`startedBefore` is the process start time, and it is load-bearing rather than defensive. The sweep
runs on a COLD project open, which includes the boot-time activation of every OTHER project five
seconds in, and inside one project's activation block the sweep is fired without awaiting while that
same project's auto-spawn runs. An unbounded sweep would stamp a genuinely in-flight enter
automation as `interrupted` and raise a toast saying it did not finish.

Nothing is retried automatically, ever. A fired webhook and a half-run script are not safe to repeat
blind, so the user gets Run again on the row instead.

### actions table (retired)

Kept in the schema so an older build can still open the database, and never read after the
automations migration. Was: `id`, `name`, `type`, `config_json`, `created_at`.

### swimlane_transitions table (retired)

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| from_swimlane_id | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| to_swimlane_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, FK->swimlanes | |
| action_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, FK->actions | |
| execution_order | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |

Note: `from_swimlane_id` has no foreign key constraint. This allows a wildcard value (`*`) as the source, meaning the transition fires regardless of which column the task came from.

Index: `idx_transitions_from_to` on (from_swimlane_id, to_swimlane_id).

Retired with `actions`, and for the same reason: it is left in place only so an older build can
open the database. Every row was converted to a `column_automations` row on the `to` column by the
automations migration, and nothing reads either table now.

### sessions table

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| task_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, FK->tasks | |
| session_type | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| agent_session_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| isolated_swimlane_id | TEXT | | NULL |

| lines_added | INTEGER | | NULL |
| lines_removed | INTEGER | | NULL |
| files_changed | INTEGER | | NULL |
| tool_breakdown | TEXT | | NULL |
| compaction_count | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |

Valid session_type values: `claude_agent`, `codex_agent`, `gemini_agent`, `qwen_agent`, `aider_agent`, `cursor_agent`, `copilot_agent`, `warp_agent`, `kimi_agent`, `opencode_agent`, `droid_agent`, `ollama_agent`, `grok_agent`, `antigravity_agent`, `goose_agent`, `run_script`.

Valid status values: `running`, `queued`, `suspended`, `exited`, `orphaned`.

Valid suspended_by values: `user` (explicit pause button), `system` (shutdown, task move, idle timeout, or a column/Board Profile edit turning `auto_spawn` off via `reconcileAutoSpawnChange`), or `NULL` (legacy records, treated as `system`).

`isolated_swimlane_id`: NULL = the task's main session; a swimlane id = the separate, context-isolated session belonging to that `isolated`-strategy column. Lets one task hold multiple independently-resumable sessions (see `docs/session-lifecycle.md` "Isolated Sessions").

Valid permission_mode values: `default`, `plan`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, `auto` (see `PermissionMode` type in `src/shared/types.ts`).

`tool_breakdown` is JSON-encoded `PerToolStat[]` (see `src/shared/types.ts`). One entry per distinct tool name with `callCount`, `totalDurationMs`, `interruptedCount`, and optional `costUsd` / `inputTokens` / `outputTokens` when the adapter emits per-tool telemetry on `tool_end` events. NULL on records captured before the column existed and on records whose session produced no tool events. Written by `captureSessionMetrics` from `UsageAccumulator` (`src/main/activity-engine/usage-accumulator.ts`), which pairs `tool_start` / `tool_end` timestamps in a per-session aggregator and is tracked independently of the bounded event cache so totals are not truncated for long sessions. A second, fire-and-forget writer, `SessionRepository.updateTranscriptToolCounts` (invoked via `refineTranscriptToolCounts` in `session-metrics.ts`, mirroring the token refinement below), backfills `tool_call_count` / `tool_breakdown` from the agent's own transcript when the live `UsageAccumulator` count is NULL or 0 (e.g. a parked/suspended session whose `tool_start` / `tool_end` hook events never reached the accumulator) - it never overwrites a nonzero live count, since the live count carries real durations and an interrupted tally the transcript-derived callCount-only breakdown cannot.

Indexes: `idx_sessions_task_started` on (task_id, started_at DESC), `idx_sessions_task_type_isolation_started` on (task_id, session_type, isolated_swimlane_id, started_at DESC) (the resume-decision hot path for per-column isolated sessions), `idx_sessions_status` on (status), `idx_sessions_agent_session_id` on (agent_session_id).

### usage_history table

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |

Indexes: `idx_usage_history_session_started_at` on (session_started_at), `idx_usage_history_recorded_at` on (recorded_at).

Append-only ledger of finalized session usage. Decoupled from `sessions` and `tasks`: rows have no foreign keys, so they survive task deletion, bulk-archive cleanup, and revert-to-backlog. The usage dashboard's period totals (Live/Today/Week/Month/All Time), cost-per-day series, and by-model / by-agent / by-effort breakdowns read from this table via `USAGE_GET_DASHBOARD_STATS` (and the `kangentic_get_usage_stats` MCP tool) so cost and token totals reflect every session ever finalized on the project, not just the ones whose source task still exists.

`agent` records which agent (claude, codex, gemini, ...) ran the session, stamped generically from the session manager's recorded agent name at capture time; a one-shot migration backfills it from surviving `sessions` -> `tasks.agent` joins, and rows whose task was already deleted stay NULL (rendered as "(unknown)").

`effort` records the session's last-applied `--effort` value, stamped at capture time from `sessions.applied_effort` (the spawn/resume/live-switch ground truth); a one-shot migration backfills it from surviving session rows. NULL means agent default (no flag) - a real bucket rendered as "(default)", not missing data. A session that switches effort mid-run attributes all of its usage to the final value (the same snapshot semantics as `model_id`).

`session_record_id` is the `sessions.id` of the row this entry mirrors. The UNIQUE constraint plus an `ON CONFLICT(session_record_id) DO UPDATE` clause in `recordSessionUsage` makes capture idempotent: re-capturing the same record at suspend AND again at app shutdown updates the existing row instead of producing duplicates. Git stat columns (`lines_added`, `lines_removed`, `files_changed`) are intentionally excluded from the UPSERT's `DO UPDATE SET` clause because they are owned by `setTaskGitStats`, which runs separately after `captureGitChurn` finishes its `git diff` against the base branch (fired on every session finalization, not just move-to-Done).

`session_started_at` is used for period bucketing (`WHERE session_started_at >= ?`) so "Today" means "session started today", not "metrics flushed today" - the difference matters for sessions that finalize across midnight. Written by `captureSessionMetrics` whenever `usage` is defined (i.e. metrics were actually captured). Cost = 0 with non-zero tokens is the Claude subscription-user case (Plus/Max) and IS recorded; the gate is `if (usage)`, not `cost > 0`. The migration backfills existing `sessions` rows with `total_cost_usd IS NOT NULL` so installs upgrading to this version do not lose their lifetime totals.

TypeScript types: `UsageDashboardStats` / `UsageKpis` (the composite read shape) in `src/shared/types.ts`. Repository: `UsageHistoryRepository` in `src/main/db/repositories/usage-history-repository.ts`; the aggregation itself lives in `src/main/usage-stats/` (`usageStatsService` + pure bucketing math), shared by the IPC handler and the MCP tool.

Index: `idx_backlog_attachments_task_id` on (backlog_task_id).

Mirrors `task_attachments` for backlog tasks. Files stored at `.kangentic/backlog/<backlogTaskId>/attachments/`. When a backlog task is promoted to a task, attachments are copied to `task_attachments` and backlog attachment files are cleaned up.

### session_transcripts table

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| session_id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| transcript | TEXT | NOT NULL | '' |
| size_bytes | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| created_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| updated_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

No foreign key constraint on `session_id`. Cascade cleanup is handled via a DELETE trigger on the `sessions` table. The `TranscriptWriter` in `src/main/pty/buffer/transcript-writer.ts` strips ANSI escape sequences from PTY output and debounces writes to this table every 30 seconds, flushing early once a session's pending buffer exceeds 256KB.

### handoffs table

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| task_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, FK->tasks ON DELETE CASCADE | |
| from_session_id | TEXT | FK->sessions ON DELETE SET NULL | |

Index: `idx_handoffs_task_id` on (task_id).

`packet_json` is a legacy column retained for schema compatibility. Current handoffs pass session context via `session_history_path` (a pointer to the source agent's native session history file). Repository queries no longer SELECT or write `packet_json`, and it is absent from the `HandoffRecord` TypeScript type.

TypeScript type: `HandoffRecord` in `src/shared/types.ts`. Repository: `HandoffRepository` in `src/main/db/repositories/handoff-repository.ts`.

### session_messages_sent table

Provenance for messages sent into a session via `kangentic_send_session_message` (see [mcp-server.md](mcp-server.md)) - by another agent, or by a human steering that session directly. The delivered message carries no in-band marker, so these rows are the only record that a turn arrived through the tool rather than being typed at the keyboard.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| session_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, FK->sessions ON DELETE CASCADE | |
| caller_session_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| caller_task_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| caller_project_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| message | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| status | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| error | TEXT | | NULL |
| created_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

Index: `idx_session_messages_sent_session_id` on (session_id).

`session_id` is the session that RECEIVED the message. `status` is one of `delivered`, `queued` (both produced a turn), `refused` (a guard rejected it), or `failed` (delivery threw; whether a turn landed is unknown) - so a row exists for every attempt, not just the successes. `error` carries the refusal or failure detail and is NULL on success.

The three `caller_*` columns are deliberately NOT foreign keys: a cross-project steer originates in a different project's database, so those ids are unresolvable locally. They are NULL for a human-driven caller with no Kangentic session.

`message` is stored as the caller supplied it, which is how a consumer correlates it to the transcript turn it produced. The delivered text is byte-identical for ordinary prose; the paste path additionally collapses CR/CRLF to LF and strips C0 control characters, so a message carrying those differs from the stored row by exactly that normalization. Reconstructing "which turns arrived this way" means filtering to `delivered` / `queued`.

TypeScript type: `SentSessionMessage` in `src/shared/types.ts`. Repository: `SentSessionMessageRepository` in `src/main/db/repositories/sent-session-message-repository.ts`.

### memory_chunks table

Conversation-memory index: a per-project retrieval store over the STRUCTURED transcript (TranscriptEntry-derived chunks), not the raw `session_transcripts` scrollback blob. Corpus-generic (a `corpus` column) so the same store can later index repo files/docs; `session_id`/`task_id` are nullable for that reuse and always set for the conversation corpus.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY (rowid) | |
| corpus | TEXT | NOT NULL | 'conversation' |
| doc_id | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| seq | INTEGER | NOT NULL | |
| session_id | TEXT | | |
| task_id | TEXT | | |
| agent_session_id | TEXT | | |
| role | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| text | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| content_hash | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| token_estimate | INTEGER | NOT NULL | |
| ts_start | INTEGER | | |
| ts_end | INTEGER | | |
| turn_uuid_start | TEXT | | |
| turn_uuid_end | TEXT | | |
| embedded_model | TEXT | | (NULL = not embedded) |
| meta_json | TEXT | | |
| created_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

Constraint: `UNIQUE(corpus, doc_id, seq)`. Indices: `idx_memory_chunks_doc` (corpus, doc_id, seq), `idx_memory_chunks_session` (session_id), `idx_memory_chunks_embedded` (embedded_model). Cascade cleanup via the `trg_sessions_delete_memory` DELETE trigger on `sessions`.

### memory_chunks_fts (FTS5)

FTS5 external-content virtual table over `memory_chunks.text` (`content='memory_chunks'`, `content_rowid='id'`, `tokenize='unicode61 remove_diacritics 2'`), kept in sync by the `trg_memory_chunks_ai`/`_ad`/`_au` triggers. Provides `bm25()` ranking and `snippet()` for conversation search. FTS5 is compiled into the shipped better-sqlite3, so this needs no extra dependency.

The vector table `memory_chunks_vec` (`USING vec0`) is NOT created by migrations: it needs the sqlite-vec extension loaded, which may be unavailable, so `RetrievalStore.ensureVecTable()` creates it lazily at runtime only when the extension loaded. No trigger references it (a missing-module trigger body would break every `DELETE FROM sessions`); vec rows are cleaned by application code.

### memory_index_state table

Per-document index bookkeeping: the source-file staleness signature (path/mtime/size) so a sweep skips unchanged sources, and a terminal `unsupported` status for raw-only agents with no structured parser.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| corpus | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| doc_id | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| session_id | TEXT | | |
| source_path | TEXT | | |
| source_mtime_ms | INTEGER | | |
| source_size | INTEGER | | |
| entry_count | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| chunk_count | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| status | TEXT | NOT NULL | 'ok' |
| indexed_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

Constraint: `PRIMARY KEY (corpus, doc_id)`. `status` is one of `ok`, `unsupported`, `missing-source`, `error`.

### memory_meta table

Key/value bookkeeping for the memory index. Holds `chunker_version`; a mismatch against the current chunker version purges and reindexes the project.

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|------|-------------|
| key | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY |
| value | TEXT | NOT NULL |

### project_meta table

Key/value bookkeeping for the project itself, distinct from `memory_meta` (which is scoped to the retrieval index). Holds `display_id_high_water`: the monotonic ceiling for `tasks.display_id` allocation.

`TaskRepository.create` allocates `max(storedHighWater, MAX(display_id)) + 1`. The stored counter is what makes numbering non-recycling: `delete()` is a hard `DELETE`, so a plain `MAX(display_id) + 1` handed a deleted task's number to the next one created. Since a worktree directory is named for its task's `display_id`, a recycled number could adopt the deleted task's leftover directory. Keeping `MAX(display_id)` in the calculation lets the counter self-heal if the row is lost or the database is restored from an older copy.

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|------|-------------|
| key | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY |
| value | TEXT | NOT NULL |

### conversation_turn_usage table

Durable per-turn token-usage ledger. One row per assistant turn that reported usage, written by `ConversationIndexer` from the parsed transcript at index time so it persists after the agent prunes its native JSONL (unlike the in-transcript `usage` field, which is re-derived on each parse). Counts are kept as raw components so cost analysis can weight fresh input against the cheaper cache reads. Read via `ConversationUsageStore` (`getForTask` / `getForSession` / `getForTurns`, plus `getGroupedUsageSince`, the UTC-bucketed project-wide read behind the usage dashboard's burn-rate and token-trend charts - 5-minute buckets for the Live period, 15-minute otherwise, bucket-only output so the payload is O(active buckets) rather than O(sessions x buckets); each bucket carries a SQL-computed `allocatedCostUsd` (per-turn shares of each owning session's `usage_history` cost), windowed by the same `session_started_at` bounds the dashboard's other reads use). All four are main-thread only (`subagent_id IS NULL`); `getSubagentTotalsByType` and `getTaskFanOuts` read the subagent rows. See "Main-thread and subagent rows" below. Of the main-thread four, only `getGroupedUsageSince` has a production caller today (the dashboard); `getForTask` / `getForSession` / `getForTurns` are the read API a conversation view would use and are currently exercised by tests only.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| turn_uuid | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| agent_session_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| session_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| task_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| model | TEXT | | NULL |
| ts | INTEGER | | NULL |
| input_tokens | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| output_tokens | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| cache_creation_input_tokens | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| cache_read_input_tokens | INTEGER | NOT NULL | 0 |
| recorded_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| subagent_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| agent_type | TEXT | | NULL |
| spawn_depth | INTEGER | | NULL |
| parent_tool_use_id | TEXT | | NULL |

Keyed by `turn_uuid` because a `--resume` replays its parent's turns verbatim under the same uuid; the PK dedups a replayed turn back onto one row so per-task / per-project totals never double-count a shared turn. That PK is the second of two guards, not the only one: an agent reports one API message's tokens on several transcript LINES, each with its own uuid, so the adapter attributes that usage to one line per `message.id` before any row is produced (see `parseTranscriptWindow` in [agent-integration.md](agent-integration.md)). Two lines of one message would otherwise reach this table under two different keys, which the PK cannot collapse. Indices: `idx_turn_usage_task` (task_id), `idx_turn_usage_session` (session_id), `idx_turn_usage_ts` (ts), `idx_turn_usage_agent_type` (agent_type, ts). Deliberately has NO `sessions` DELETE cascade (unlike `memory_chunks`): it is a durable ledger, not a rebuildable index, so token history outlives the session rows it describes.

#### Main-thread and subagent rows

`subagent_id` is the discriminator. It is NULL for a main-thread (driver) turn and set for a turn a Task-tool subagent ran, along with `agent_type` (`review-finder`, `test-builder`, `Explore`, ...), `spawn_depth`, and `parent_tool_use_id` (the tool-use id of the call that spawned it). Every row written before subagent capture existed is a main-thread turn, so NULL is also the right historical value.

`parent_tool_use_id` is NOT a key of this table, and it does not always point at a main-thread row. It names a tool call, which `turn_spawn_links` maps to the turn that emitted it: a main-thread turn at depth 1, another subagent's turn deeper. Resolving a nested subagent to the fan-out that ultimately caused it therefore takes a walk, not a join, which is what `getTaskFanOuts` does.

Every driver-facing reader spells `subagent_id IS NULL`: `getForTask`, `getForSession`, `getForTurns`, and `getGroupedUsageSince`. In `getGroupedUsageSince` the clause appears in BOTH the outer aggregate and the `session_tokens` CTE, because that CTE is the denominator of the per-turn cost allocation: filtering only the outer query leaves every token count correct while silently redistributing a session's cost into the subagents' time buckets. Two readers want the other set (`subagent_id IS NOT NULL`), and neither reports cost, because `usage_history.total_cost_usd` already covers the whole session tree and pricing these tokens again would double count. `getSubagentTotalsByType` groups by `agent_type` and carries the depth aggregates (`nestedTurnCount`, `nestedSubagentCount`, `maxSpawnDepth`, all computed from `spawn_depth` with no join, so they work on every historical row). `getTaskFanOuts` groups one task's subagent turns by the DRIVER TURN that started each fan-out, which the per-type rollup cannot express: a `/code-review` task spawns the same `review-finder` type from several different turns.

Subagents whose parent does not resolve are returned by `getTaskFanOuts` under a null driver rather than dropped. Links only exist for sessions indexed since `turn_spawn_links` shipped, so on an older task that bucket is everything; omitting it would make the fan-out rows disagree with the per-type totals over the same task.

#### turn_spawn_links table

The other half of `parent_tool_use_id`. One row per subagent-spawning tool call, mapping that call's id to the turn that emitted it.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| tool_use_id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | |
| turn_uuid | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| recorded_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

Index: `idx_turn_spawn_links_turn` (turn_uuid), which serves the reverse direction (given a driver turn, which spawns did it make); the forward direction rides the primary key. No `sessions` DELETE cascade, for the same reason the ledger it serves has none.

Deliberately minimal: `turn_uuid` joins straight back to `conversation_turn_usage`, which already carries `session_id` / `task_id` / `ts`, so denormalizing them here would only create a second copy to keep in sync. Rows are written by whichever parser saw the emitting turn - the main transcript for a depth-1 spawn, the subagent transcript for a deeper one - which is what lets a nested subagent resolve to the subagent that spawned it rather than only to a depth number.

Which tool counts as a spawn is the adapter's `subagentSpawnToolName` (Claude: `Task`), not a literal in the retrieval layer. Filtering on it is what keeps the table small: a session emits thousands of tool-use ids and only the spawning ones are ever referenced.

Links are collected INDEPENDENTLY of the usage fold in both parsers. Each drops turns before they reach the ledger (the main path skips an entry with no `usage`; the subagent path skips a message group whose four counts are all zero), and a link lost to either filter is lost for good, because a re-walk drops it identically and that subtree becomes permanently unattributable. Tokens are recoverable; this is not.

Subagent rows are written by `ConversationIndexer.indexSubagentUsage` from the Claude adapter's `parseSubagentUsage`, which reads `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<agentSessionId>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` plus its `.meta.json` sidecar. That walk has its own `memory_index_state` row (doc id `<agentSessionId>#subagents`) because a running subagent moves no byte of the main transcript, and it runs on session finalize and the project-open sweep only, never on the live turn-boundary re-index. A `turn_uuid` there is `sub:<subagentId>:<message.id>` - stable across re-walks and disjoint from the main path's JSONL record uuids. Usage is folded field-wise max per `message.id`, not first-record-wins: subagent transcripts re-emit a message as its output grows, and taking the first record undercounts output by about 30%.

Module: `src/main/retrieval/` (store `RetrievalStore`, usage ledger `ConversationUsageStore`, indexer `ConversationIndexer`, service `retrievalService`, query `searchConversationMemory`).

### session_activity_intervals table

Durable activity-disposition ledger. One row per continuous span a session spent in one `ActivityDisposition` bucket - `'idle'` (needing the user, covering both the `idle` and `permission` activity states) or `'active'` (the agent working on its own, the `thinking` state); see `dispositionOf` in `src/shared/activity-state.ts`. Written the moment the activity engine commits a disposition-changing transition, so it survives the engine's own in-memory state (wiped on `deleteSession`/dispose) and is faithful where `events.jsonl` is not (that file logs raw hook events, not committed transitions, and is not reliably retained). Symmetric by design: both dispositions are recorded directly, so "active time" and "idle time" are each a straight SUM rather than an inverse requiring session-boundary reconciliation.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| id | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | |
| session_id | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| task_id | TEXT | | NULL |
| disposition | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| state | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| previous_state | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| enter_trigger | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| started_ms | INTEGER | NOT NULL | |
| started_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| ended_ms | INTEGER | | NULL |
| ended_at | TEXT | | NULL |
| duration_ms | INTEGER | | NULL |
| exit_trigger | TEXT | | NULL |
| recorded_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

One row per INTERVAL, not per transition: a `permission` to `idle` crossing stays inside the same `'idle'`-disposition interval, so nothing closes and reopens. `enter_trigger` / `exit_trigger` carry the engine's own `TransitionTrigger` labels, so a consumer can tell a hook-authoritative park (`event:idle`) from a watchdog guess (`timer:stale-thinking`), and a genuine human reply (`event:prompt`) from the agent resuming itself (`event:prompt:pty-activity`). `started_at` / `ended_at` are TEXT UTC ISO 8601 mirrors of `started_ms` / `ended_ms`, written by the store from the same value so the two representations cannot drift; `ended_at` is NULL exactly when `ended_ms` is (the interval is still open). Indices: `idx_activity_intervals_task` (task_id), `idx_activity_intervals_session` (session_id), `idx_activity_intervals_started` (started_ms), `idx_activity_intervals_open` (session_id, ended_ms - resolves the one open interval per session without holding row ids across a restart). Deliberately has NO `sessions` DELETE cascade, for the same reason as `conversation_turn_usage`: it is a durable ledger, so an interval outlives the session row that produced it. Both ordinary ends close the open interval: the PTY's `exit`, and `session-removed` for a direct `SessionManager.remove()`, which deletes the registry row synchronously and so lands before that exit can resolve a project (see [session-lifecycle.md](session-lifecycle.md)). Only an abrupt end that fires neither, an app crash or an OS kill, leaves an interval permanently open; consumers filter `ended_ms IS NOT NULL`.

Module: `src/main/activity-engine/` (store `ActivityIntervalStore`, recorder `ActivityIntervalRecorder`). Read via the `kangentic_get_activity_intervals` MCP tool (see [mcp-server.md](mcp-server.md)) or `kangentic_query_db`; there is no desktop-facing IPC endpoint yet.

### remote_item_cache table

Persistent cache of remote board items for the Import dialog, keyed by `(external_source, repository, external_id)`. It lets the dialog paint instantly on open (`backlog:importGetCached`, no network) and reconcile only items changed since the cache's high-water mark (`MAX(remote_updated_at)`, via `backlog:importReconcile`). Being in the per-project DB, it survives app restart and project switch. `alreadyImported` is never stored: it is re-stamped from the live backlog (`backlog_tasks` + `tasks`) on every read.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| external_source | TEXT | NOT NULL, PK | |
| repository | TEXT | NOT NULL, PK | |
| external_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, PK | |
| remote_updated_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| state_category | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| payload | TEXT | NOT NULL | |
| fetched_at | TEXT | NOT NULL | |

`payload` is the JSON-serialized list-level `ExternalIssue` (body is the description only; Azure DevOps comments are deferred to import time). `state_category` is the normalized `'open' | 'closed'` bucket, kept for a future SQL-level filter; the copy the dialog actually reads is `stateCategory` inside `payload`, so treat the payload as the source of truth and write both together. The column cannot simply be dropped: the table is created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, which does not reshape a database that already has it, so removing the column from the DDL would leave a NOT NULL column that every insert then omits. Retiring it needs its own migration. `remote_updated_at` mirrors `ExternalIssue.updatedAt`, canonicalized to UTC ISO 8601 on write because the column is TEXT and its MAX is compared lexicographically; that MAX is the incremental `since` watermark. `MIN(fetched_at)` is when the cache was last known complete, which is how the reconcile decides a provider with no cheap id listing is overdue for a full pass. Timestamps are UTC ISO 8601 written via `toISOString()`. The composite PK bounds every read to one source's rows (the `(external_source, repository)` prefix scan, and the MAX watermark and DESC sort within that range), so no separate index is needed at these sizes. Repository: `RemoteItemCacheRepository` (`src/main/db/repositories/remote-item-cache-repository.ts`).

## Migration Strategy

Migrations run automatically on database open via `runGlobalMigrations()` (from `src/main/db/migrations/global-schema.ts`) and `runProjectMigrations()` (from `src/main/db/migrations/project-schema.ts`). Default swimlane seeding lives in `src/main/db/migrations/default-data.ts`; nothing seeds actions, transitions or automations any more. The strategy uses three approaches depending on the change:

- **Initial schema** uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so first-run and re-runs are idempotent.
- **Incremental changes** use `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with existence checks via `PRAGMA table_info()` to avoid errors on already-migrated databases.
- **Table recreation** is used when foreign key constraints need removal (e.g., `swimlane_transitions` wildcard source required dropping the FK on `from_swimlane_id`).
- **Data migrations** (e.g., converting explicit transitions to wildcards, updating legacy permission modes) run alongside schema changes.

### Key Migrations (Per-Project DB)

Grouped by feature. The numbering is for cross-reference only and does not reflect the exact execution order within `runProjectMigrations()` (several column adds run earlier or later than their position here suggests):

1. **`role` column on swimlanes** -- adds the `role` column and backfills `todo` (originally `backlog`), `planning`, `running` by position, plus `done` for archived columns.
2. **`icon` column on swimlanes** -- adds custom icon support.
3. **`archived_at` column on tasks** -- supports the Done auto-archive feature.
4. **`base_branch` column on tasks** -- per-task base branch override.
5. **`use_worktree` column on tasks** -- per-task worktree override.
6. **`swimlane_transitions` table recreation** -- drops the foreign key constraint on `from_swimlane_id` to allow wildcard `*` source. SQLite requires full table recreation to remove a constraint.
7. **Wildcard transition data migration** -- converts explicit per-source transitions (e.g., To Do->Planning) into wildcard transitions (*->Planning). Groups by target swimlane and action, keeping the lowest execution_order.
8. **`task_attachments` table** -- creates the table with `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `task_id` and an index on `task_id`.
9. **`spawn_agent` config data migrations** (single pass over all spawn_agent actions):
   - Appends `{{attachments}}` to prompt templates that lack it
   - Removes legacy permission modes (`dangerously-skip`, `bypass-permissions`) from action config (action-level permissionMode was removed in a later migration)
   - Updates old `Task: {{title}}...` prompt template to `{{title}}{{description}}{{attachments}}`
   - Migrates the prior default `{{title}}{{description}}{{attachments}}` to the XML envelope form `{{task_xml}}{{attachments}}` (only rewrites exact-match defaults; user-customized templates are left alone)
10. **`permission_strategy` and `auto_spawn` columns on swimlanes** -- adds per-column permission strategy and auto-spawn toggle. Backfills: todo/done get `auto_spawn = 0`, planning gets `permission_strategy = 'plan'`, running role is converted to a custom column. (Column later renamed to `permission_mode` in migration 17.)
11. **`auto_command` column on swimlanes** -- per-column auto-command support.
12. **`is_terminal` renamed to `is_archived`** -- uses `ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN`.
13. **`plan_exit_target_id` column on swimlanes** -- adds plan exit target and removes the `planning` system role. Sets icon to `map` for former planning-role columns, clears the role, and auto-sets `plan_exit_target_id` to the next column by position.
14. **`suspended_by` column on sessions** -- tracks who suspended the session (`user` or `system`). Used by session recovery to skip user-paused sessions on relaunch.
15. **`is_ghost` column on swimlanes** -- adds ghost column support for board config reconciliation. Ghost columns are columns removed from `kangentic.json` but still holding tasks.
16. **Session metrics columns** -- adds `total_cost_usd`, `total_input_tokens`, `total_output_tokens`, `model_id`, `model_display_name`, `total_duration_ms`, `tool_call_count`, `lines_added`, `lines_removed`, `files_changed`, `tool_breakdown` to sessions for completed task summaries. The same idempotent ALTER TABLE loop adds new metric columns over time; `tool_breakdown` was appended later for per-tool aggregates.
17. **`permission_strategy` column renamed to `permission_mode`** -- renames the `permission_strategy` column to `permission_mode` on swimlanes. Migrates old values: `bypass-permissions` to `bypassPermissions`, removes `manual` (alias for `default`). Adds `dontAsk` as a new valid mode. Also removes `permissionMode` from action `config_json` (action-level override removed; resolution is now swimlane override then global setting).
18. **Legacy `permission_mode` value normalization** -- unconditional data migration that runs on every DB open. Normalizes legacy values in both swimlanes and sessions: `project-settings` to `default`, `manual` to `default`, `dangerously-skip` to `bypassPermissions`, `bypass-permissions` to `bypassPermissions`. Ensures all records use the current `PermissionMode` union values regardless of when they were created.
19. **Swimlane role rename (`backlog` to `todo`)** -- renames the "Backlog" swimlane to "To Do" (also catches "Not Started") and migrates role values from `backlog` to `todo`.
20. **`backlog_tasks` table** -- creates the staging area table for the Backlog View feature. Stores pre-board tasks with priority, labels, external source tracking, and position ordering. Includes indexes on position and (external_source, external_id). Databases that created this table under its original name `backlog_items` are renamed to `backlog_tasks` (and `backlog_attachments.backlog_item_id` to `backlog_task_id`) for existing DBs.
21. **`backlog_attachments` table** -- creates the attachment table for backlog tasks with `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `backlog_task_id` and an index on `backlog_task_id`. Mirrors `task_attachments` structure.
22. **Import-related columns on `backlog_tasks`** -- adds `assignee`, `due_date`, `item_type`, and `external_metadata` columns for richer external source integration (GitHub Issues, GitHub Projects, Azure DevOps).
23. **`display_id` column on tasks** -- adds a human-readable sequential integer ID for tasks. Backfills existing tasks with sequential IDs ordered by `created_at ASC`. Creates a unique index on `display_id`.
24. **`labels` and `priority` columns on tasks** -- adds label and priority support to board tasks (mirroring backlog_tasks). Labels default to `'[]'` (JSON array), priority defaults to `0`. Preserved during promote from backlog.
25. **`claude_session_id` renamed to `agent_session_id`** -- renames the `claude_session_id` column to `agent_session_id` on the `sessions` table. Generalizes the column name to support multiple agent adapters.
26. **`agent_override` column on swimlanes** -- adds per-column agent override support. When set, tasks moving into this column use the specified agent instead of the project default.
27. **`handoff_context` column on swimlanes** -- adds per-column toggle for cross-agent handoff context packaging. Default `0` (off) - users must opt in. When enabled, agent transitions package transcript, git diff, and metrics for the target agent.
28. **`model_override` and `effort_override` columns on swimlanes and tasks** -- adds per-column model and effort/reasoning level overrides. Both default to NULL (inherit agent default). Read at spawn time by `prepare-spawn.ts` to set `--model` / `--effort` CLI flags. Live-applied to running sessions via adapter-specific slash injection (`getInjectionSequence`) on column transition; falls back to suspend+respawn for adapters without live-swap support. The same migration block also adds `model_override` and `effort_override` columns to the **tasks** table for per-task overrides set via the ContextBar popover. Per-task values take precedence over the swimlane override; NULL falls through to the swimlane and ultimately to the agent default.
29. **`agent_override` column on tasks** -- adds per-task agent override set at task creation via the New Task dialog's Advanced section. Wins over `swimlane.agent_override` and the project default for the task's entire lifetime; column moves cannot change the agent. NULL means inherit from the swimlane. Resolved at spawn time by `resolveTargetAgent()` (priority 1) in `src/main/transition-engine/agent-resolver.ts`. Companion guard in `task-move.ts` skips the cross-agent clear of `model_override` / `effort_override` when `agent_override` is set, since those values were picked for the locked agent.
30. **`session_transcripts` table** -- creates the table for storing ANSI-stripped PTY transcripts. No FK constraint; uses a DELETE trigger on `sessions` for cascade cleanup.
31. **`handoffs` table** -- creates the table for tracking cross-agent context handoffs. FK on `task_id` with CASCADE delete, FKs on `from_session_id` and `to_session_id` with SET NULL. Indexed on `task_id`.
32. **Remove hardcoded agent from `spawn_agent` action configs** -- data migration that strips a legacy `agent: 'claude'` value from existing `spawn_agent` action `config_json`. The seed data previously hardcoded `agent: 'claude'`, which shadowed the project default and per-column `agent_override`; clearing it lets the agent resolution chain respect user configuration. Malformed configs are skipped.
33. **`session_history_path` column on handoffs** -- adds the `session_history_path TEXT` column to the `handoffs` table. Session history passthrough stores the source agent's native session history file path instead of a manufactured context packet, so `packet_json` becomes a legacy column that repository queries no longer read or write.
34. **Performance indices on sessions and tasks** -- adds idempotent hot-path indices: `idx_sessions_task_started` on (task_id, started_at DESC) for per-task session lookups and cost summaries, `idx_sessions_task_type_isolation_started` on (task_id, session_type, isolated_swimlane_id, started_at DESC) for the per-column isolated-session resume-decision path, `idx_sessions_status` on (status) for getResumable/getOrphaned/markRunningAsOrphaned, `idx_sessions_agent_session_id` on (agent_session_id) for the resume-by-agent-id path, and `idx_tasks_session_id` on (session_id) for session-change IPC events. Targets startup reconciliation and live board state lookups under accumulated session history.
35. **`external_id`, `external_source`, `external_url` columns on tasks** -- carries external origin (GitHub/Asana/etc.) onto board tasks promoted from imported backlog items, plus an `idx_tasks_external` index on (external_source, external_id). Promotion deletes the `backlog_tasks` row, so without these columns the board task loses all trace of its origin and the same issue could be re-imported. The dedup query (`findByExternalIds`) now unions `backlog_tasks` with `tasks` (archived included) so a previously imported-and-promoted issue stays "imported". Carried back through demote via `createFromTask`.
36. **`usage_history` append-only ledger** -- creates the `usage_history` table (in the initial `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block) plus two query indices (`idx_usage_history_session_started_at`, `idx_usage_history_recorded_at`) for StatusBar period bucketing. Adds a one-shot guarded backfill that copies existing `sessions` rows where `total_cost_usd IS NOT NULL` into `usage_history` so installs upgrading to this version retain their lifetime totals. Backfill is wrapped in a single transaction and uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` plus a `COUNT(*) = 0` guard so re-running is safe. Rows in this table have no foreign keys to `tasks` or `sessions`, so totals survive task deletion (the original bug this feature fixes).
37. **`pr_state` column on tasks** -- adds `pr_state TEXT DEFAULT NULL` so the authoritative branch->PR resolver can persist normalized PR state (`open`/`draft`/`merged`/`closed`) and re-resolution can reflect state changes on the card pill. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
38. **`head_sha` column on tasks** -- adds `head_sha TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, the captured worktree HEAD commit SHA. An immutable anchor that lets PR resolution match by commit (each PR connector's `resolveByCommit`; GitHub via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/pulls`, Azure DevOps via `pullrequestquery`) even after the worktree is reclaimed on Done or the branch is renamed. Captured opportunistically during resolution, from the worktree HEAD before every cleanup path that removes the directory (the Done move, a To Do reset or delete, the `cleanup_worktree` action), and from the surviving local branch ref via `readLocalBranchSha` when only the directory is already gone (the startup worktree-missing fallbacks, the Backlog resource sweep). `tests/unit/pushed-branch-cleanup-parity.test.ts` checks that every write nulling `branch_name` carries the capture. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
39. **`isolated_swimlane_id` column on sessions** - adds `isolated_swimlane_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL` so a task can hold multiple parallel, independently-resumable sessions. NULL = the task's main session; a swimlane id = the separate, context-isolated session belonging to that `isolated`-target column. Existing rows are NULL (main). Companion index `idx_sessions_task_type_isolation_started` (see migration 34) keys the resume-decision lookup. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
40. **`applied_model` and `applied_effort` columns on sessions** - adds `applied_model TEXT DEFAULT NULL` and `applied_effort TEXT DEFAULT NULL`. They record the model/effort a session was actually spawned, resumed, or live-switched with (the `--model` / `--effort` flag value; NULL = agent default, no flag). Both feed the column-transition injection delta in `prepareInjectionPlan`, which injects `/model` or `/effort` only when the session's real running value differs from the destination's effective value, so a drifted column config (or a null leaving-column) no longer triggers a spurious injection. The two differ in standing: `applied_model` is the sole source for the model delta, but for effort it is a FALLBACK rather than the ground truth. `resolveSourceEffort` prefers the level the agent itself reports (`task.effort_override ?? <agent-reported effort> ?? applied_effort`), because these columns record only what Kangentic last asked for and an `/effort` typed straight into the terminal never reaches them. See [Command Injection](command-injection.md) for the canonical precedence and why model is deliberately excluded from live sourcing. Maintained by `SessionRepository.updateAppliedSettings` at spawn/resume and after every live settings switch. Distinct from `model_id` (the agent-reported model captured at exit via metrics). Both columns are idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
41. **Per-column session model on swimlanes (`session_target` + `session_spawn_strategy`)** - renames the original `session_strategy` column to `session_target` (`main` | `isolated`, values unchanged) via a guarded `RENAME COLUMN`, and adds `session_spawn_strategy TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'create_or_resume'` (`create_or_resume` | `always_spawn_new`). Idempotent across fresh DBs, DBs still on the old `session_strategy` column, and already-migrated DBs. Together they select which session track a column runs a task on and whether it resumes or always spawns fresh on entry; the fresh-vs-resume default is context-aware (`resolveForceFresh`). See `docs/session-lifecycle.md` "Isolated Sessions".
42. **`description` column on swimlanes** - adds `description TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, a free-form, team-shared blurb describing a column's purpose. Surfaced as a header tooltip and round-trips through `kangentic.json` (`BoardColumnConfig.description`). Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
43. **`compaction_count` columns on sessions and usage_history** - adds `compaction_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to `sessions` (via the metrics-columns loop, migration 16) and the same to `usage_history` (in the `CREATE TABLE` block plus a guarded `ALTER TABLE` for existing DBs). Counts context compactions per CLI run (Claude `PreCompact` hook -> `EventType.Compact`, counted in `UsageAccumulator`); the per-task lifetime "sessions compacted" total is the SUM across the task's session rows. NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 so existing rows and never-compacted runs aggregate correctly.
44. **`detail_view_state` column on tasks** - adds `detail_view_state TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, a per-task JSON blob (`TaskDetailViewState`) holding the task-detail dialog's layout (divider ratio, which side panel is open, Changes view mode, selected diff file, reviewed files, diff scope, file-tree width, selected commit in the Changes panel's history browser, and whether the rail's History section is expanded plus its height). Hydrated into the session store on board load and saved debounced via the task-scoped `TASK_SET_DETAIL_VIEW_STATE` IPC so reopening a task restores its layout across restarts. The dedicated `setDetailViewState` writer deliberately does not bump `updated_at` (view-state churn must not reorder the board). Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
45. **Conversation-memory index (`memory_chunks` + FTS + `memory_index_state` + `memory_meta`)** - creates the per-project retrieval store over the structured transcript: `memory_chunks` (corpus-generic chunk store, `UNIQUE(corpus, doc_id, seq)`), the `memory_chunks_fts` FTS5 external-content shadow (with `_ai`/`_ad`/`_au` sync triggers), `memory_index_state` (per-doc staleness signature + status), and `memory_meta` (chunker version). Cascade cleanup via `trg_sessions_delete_memory` on `sessions`. The `memory_chunks_vec` (vec0) table is created at runtime by `RetrievalStore.ensureVecTable()` only when the sqlite-vec extension loaded, never by migrations, and no trigger references it. Idempotent `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`.
46. **Durable per-turn token-usage ledger (`conversation_turn_usage`)** - creates the table plus its `idx_turn_usage_task` / `idx_turn_usage_session` / `idx_turn_usage_ts` indices. One row per assistant turn that reported usage, keyed by `turn_uuid` (so a `--resume` replay dedups back onto one row), populated by `ConversationIndexer` from the parsed transcript at index time so token counts survive the agent pruning its native JSONL. Deliberately has NO `sessions` DELETE cascade (unlike `memory_chunks`): it is a long-lived ledger, not a rebuildable index, so token history outlives the session rows it describes. See the `conversation_turn_usage table` section above. Idempotent `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`.
47. **`permission_mode` column on tasks** - adds `permission_mode TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, a per-task permission override mirroring `agent_override`/`model_override`/`effort_override`: settable via the New Task dialog's Advanced section and the task-detail edit form (pre-spawn or suspended only, same lock as `agent_override`). Takes precedence over the swimlane's `permission_mode` and the project's default permission mode; NULL means inherit. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
48. **`auto_command` column on tasks** - adds `auto_command TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, an MCP-only per-task initial command set via `kangentic_create_task`'s `autoCommand` param so a skill can mint a task that runs a command (e.g. `/code-review`) once the agent spawns. Not surfaced in the New Task dialog or project settings. Takes precedence over the swimlane's `auto_command` for this task only; NULL means inherit from the swimlane. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
49. **`agent` and `effort` columns on `usage_history`** - adds `agent TEXT` and `effort TEXT` (both in the `CREATE TABLE` block plus guarded `ALTER TABLE` for existing DBs) so the usage dashboard can break usage down by agent and by reasoning effort. `agent` is stamped at capture time from the session manager's recorded agent name; `effort` from `sessions.applied_effort` (the last-applied `--effort` value, NULL = agent default). Each has a one-shot backfill: `agent` from surviving `sessions` -> `tasks.agent` joins, `effort` from surviving `sessions.applied_effort`. Rows whose source was deleted stay NULL (rendered "(unknown)" / "(default)"). The one-shot `usage_history` seed backfill (migration 36) also carries both columns. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
50. **Durable activity-disposition-interval ledger (`session_activity_intervals`)** - creates the table plus its `idx_activity_intervals_task` / `idx_activity_intervals_session` / `idx_activity_intervals_started` / `idx_activity_intervals_open` indices. One row per continuous span a session spent in the `'active'` or `'idle'` `ActivityDisposition` bucket, written by `ActivityIntervalRecorder` the moment the activity engine commits a disposition-changing transition - symmetric by design (both dispositions recorded directly, not one derived as the inverse of the other). `started_at`/`ended_at` mirror `started_ms`/`ended_ms` as UTC ISO 8601, derived from the same value at write time. Deliberately has NO `sessions` DELETE cascade (same rationale as `conversation_turn_usage`): a durable ledger, so an interval outlives the session row that produced it. See the `session_activity_intervals table` section above. Idempotent `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`.
51. **Sent-message provenance (`session_messages_sent`)** - creates the table plus `idx_session_messages_sent_session_id`, recording every `kangentic_send_session_message` ATTEMPT (`delivered` / `queued` / `refused` / `failed`) against the session that received it. `session_id` cascades on `sessions` DELETE; the three `caller_*` columns are deliberately plain ids, not foreign keys, because a cross-project steer originates in another project's database. Followed by a guarded `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN error TEXT` so a database created by the intermediate (pre-`error`) shape picks the column up. Because the delivered message carries no in-band marker, these rows are the only record that a turn arrived through the tool rather than being typed. See the `session_messages_sent table` section above. Idempotent `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` + `pragma table_info` guard.
52. **`profile_id` column on tasks** - adds `profile_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, naming the Board Profile a task rides: a team-shared, named alternate set of per-column strategy settings applied as the task moves (see the `tasks table` section above and [Configuration > Board Profiles](configuration.md#board-profiles)). No foreign key and no backfill: profile *definitions* live in `kangentic.json` while this assignment is per-machine, and NULL already means the synthetic "Default" (every column uses its own settings), so an existing board needs no data migration and behaves byte-identically until a profile is created. Mutually exclusive with `agent_override` / `model_override` / `effort_override` / `permission_mode`, enforced in `TaskRepository`. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
53. **`run_mode` column on tasks** - adds `run_mode TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'column_settings'`, recording which of the New Task / Edit dialog's two branches the user chose (`'column_settings'` | `'agent_override'`, the `TaskRunMode` union). Previously the branch was derived on mount from "does the task carry any of the four Advanced pins", which cannot represent Agent Override with all four fields left on inherit: that saves the same five nulls as Column Settings, so the choice was dropped on every save and `lockAdvancedOverridesOnFirstSpawn` never fired. Backfills `'agent_override'` for any row where `agent_override`, `model_override`, `effort_override`, or `permission_mode` is non-NULL **and** `profile_id IS NULL` - exactly the old derivation, so upgraded boards behave identically; `auto_command` is excluded (not an Advanced pin) and profile tasks carry no pins, so both stay on `'column_settings'`. The `profile_id IS NULL` clause changes no row today (the repository has enforced profile-vs-pin exclusivity since `profile_id` shipped) but makes the backfill correct by construction rather than by trusting that invariant. Joins the profile-vs-pin exclusivity set in `applyProfileExclusivity` (see the `tasks table` section above). Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE` + backfill `UPDATE`, both inside a single `db.transaction()`: the guard tests only for the column's existence, so a crash between the two statements would leave the column present, the guard satisfied, and the backfill never run again.
54. **Monotonic `display_id` high-water mark (`project_meta`)** - creates the key/value `project_meta` table and seeds `display_id_high_water` from `COALESCE(MAX(display_id), 0)`. `TaskRepository.create` now allocates `max(storedHighWater, MAX(display_id)) + 1` inside a transaction instead of the bare `MAX(display_id) + 1`. Numbers previously recycled: `delete()` is a hard `DELETE`, so removing the highest-numbered task handed its number straight to the next task created. That became a correctness problem once worktree directories were named after `display_id`, because a recycled number could adopt the deleted task's leftover directory. `MAX(display_id)` stays in the calculation so the counter self-heals if the row is lost or the database is restored from an older copy. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so a re-run never clobbers an advanced counter.
55. **`worktree_folder` column on tasks** - adds `worktree_folder TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, the write-once directory NAME of a task's worktree, and backfills it from `basename(worktree_path)` for every task that has one. New worktrees are named for the task's `display_id`; worktrees created before that keep their legacy `<slug>-<taskId8>` name, so nothing on disk is renamed or relocated. The column is what makes "new worktrees only" true: moving to Done nulls `worktree_path`, so moving back out is a **fresh creation**, and without a durable record a pre-existing task would be rebuilt at a different path - orphaning its agent transcript (Claude keys it by a slug of the cwd, so `--resume` reports "No conversation found"). (The browser cookie jar, also path-keyed when this migration shipped, is now keyed by task identity - `browserPartitionForTask` - and no longer depends on path stability.) Deliberately **not** backfilled from `sessions.cwd`: `runProjectMigrations` receives only the database handle, and without the project path it cannot tell a task's own worktree cwd apart from a project that is itself checked out at a worktree path (an opened worktree, or a `/preview` ephemeral project), where a bare marker search would write a permanently wrong value into a write-once column. That case is recovered at use time instead by `TaskRepository.recoverLegacyWorktreeFolder`, which anchors on the project's own worktrees root. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE` + backfill inside `db.transaction()`.

56. **`auto_command_mode` column on swimlanes** - adds `auto_command_mode TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'immediate'`, declaring WHEN a column's `auto_command` fires: `'immediate'` (inject on arrival, interrupting the agent's current turn if there is one) or `'deferred'` (hold until that turn genuinely finishes, judged by activity `idle` AND a quiet PTY - see [Command Injection](command-injection.md)). No backfill is needed: `'immediate'` is exactly the behavior every existing column already had. Team-shared, so it round-trips through `kangentic.json` as `autoCommandMode` alongside `autoCommand`. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
57. **auto_command outcome columns on tasks** - adds `auto_command_state`, `auto_command_text`, `auto_command_error`, and `auto_command_at` (all `TEXT DEFAULT NULL`), recording what happened to the task's most recent auto_command injection so a failure is observable instead of a console warning nobody sees. `auto_command_state` is one of `'confirmed' | 'unconfirmed' | 'escalated' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'`; `auto_command_at` is UTC ISO 8601. `'unconfirmed'` is NOT a failure - only Claude implements a `command-injection` verifier, so on every other agent a delivery can only ever land there, and conflating the two would make the field meaningless off Claude. Written by `reportAutoCommandOutcome` outside the normal `update()` path so engine telemetry never bumps `updated_at`. Four idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`s.
58. **`worktree_skip_reason` column on tasks** - adds `worktree_skip_reason TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, recording why a task's last spawn ran WITHOUT a worktree (the `WorktreeSkipReason` union: `'disabled' | 'not-a-repo' | 'nested-worktree' | 'no-commits' | 'remote-agent' | 'worktree-missing'`). `WorktreeManager.ensureWorktree` used to collapse every guard into one silent `null`, so nothing could tell the user their agent was running in the shared project checkout - the tree the app itself runs from; it now returns a `WorktreeSkipped` naming the reason, and `ensureTaskWorktree` / the `create_worktree` action / startup recovery persist it. Recorded and exposed but not yet read by any renderer surface: the 12px card glyph that drew it was reviewed out as too small to tell apart, so the card marker and the detail header's "Project folder" chip still read `worktree_path`. Written by `TaskRepository.setWorktreeSkipReason` outside the normal `update()` path (no `updated_at` bump), cleared inside `recordWorktree`'s transaction and on a To Do reset or Done move. No backfill: NULL correctly means "never evaluated". Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
59. **Out-of-union swimlane role repair** - unconditional data migration clearing any `swimlanes.role` that is neither `todo` nor `done`, so a column this build does not know as a system column is stored as one (role NULL). The `role` column is plain `TEXT` with no CHECK constraint, and the earlier `planning`/`running` conversions (migrations 10 and 13) each sit inside a one-shot `if (!hasColumn)` guard, so a database whose `permission_mode` and `plan_exit_target_id` columns already existed never ran them, and a role arriving later from a teammate's `kangentic.json` was never converted at all. Those values then reached the renderer's two-key role-to-icon map and rendered `<undefined />`, blanking the board (Sentry DESKTOP-D). Runs on every open, so it also repairs a role written after the schema settles. Deliberately the last statement that REPAIRS a `role`: migration 19 PROMOTES `backlog` to `todo`, and clearing it first would leave the board with no To Do role for `applyBoardConfigToDb` to find. The default seed's own INSERT runs later still, but it writes trusted literals into a fresh table rather than repairing an existing value. The placeholder list is built from `SWIMLANE_ROLES` (`src/shared/types.ts`) so it cannot drift from the union. Being unconditional rather than one-shot has an accepted cost: if a future build adds a third system role, an OLDER build opening the same project nulls it on disk. `exportFromDb` also runs on every open (`deferBoardConfigReconcile` in `ipc/handlers/projects.ts`), so that same open writes the nulled role back into the committed `kangentic.json`, and the newer build's role does not survive one open on the older build. That is the deliberate trade for repairing a role that arrives after the schema settles, which is the case migrations 10 and 13 missed.
60. **`pushed_branch` column on tasks** - adds `pushed_branch TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, the branch a task's work was actually PUSHED to when that differs from the local `branch_name`. Agents push under a team convention (`maint/adopt-central-package-management`) while the worktree stays on the Kangentic slug, and nothing reconciled the two, so every branch-keyed PR anchor looked up a branch no PR was opened from and the card stayed bare. Written from the agent's own `git push` (the destination its command named, recorded when that call ends; `src/main/activity-engine/push-command-detector.ts`), by `kangentic_link_pr`'s `branch` argument, and opportunistically by the PR linker's Tier 6, which finds the remote branch whose tip is the task's HEAD; read back as the Tier 5 anchor. For a task created with `useWorktree: false` it is the ONLY PR anchor the app can record, since every other one is written from a worktree read. Deliberately a separate column rather than a correction to `branch_name`: that one names the LOCAL branch a restore re-attaches to, verified with `rev-parse --verify`, which does not resolve a remote-only branch, so writing a pushed-only name there would fork a fresh branch off base and orphan the work. A remote fact that outlives the local checkout, so NO cleanup path nulls it (it once was nulled alongside `branch_name`, which stranded a task whose PR had not linked before a reset); `tests/unit/pushed-branch-cleanup-parity.test.ts` enforces that the row insert is the only `pushed_branch: null` write. No backfill: NULL correctly means "never observed". Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
61. **`resolved_base_branch` column on tasks** - adds `resolved_base_branch TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, the base branch a task's worktree was ACTUALLY cut from, as `WorktreeManager.createWorktree` resolved it against the repo's real refs. Written by `recordWorktree` in the same transaction as `worktree_path` / `branch_name`, and read by the PR linker as `base_branch ?? resolved_base_branch ?? defaultBaseBranch ?? 'main'`, and by `kangentic_list_worktrees` through the same chain (`RequestResolver.resolveWorktreeBaseRef`) to pick the `baseRef` a worktree's ahead/behind counts are measured against. Distinct from `base_branch`, which holds only a base the USER named explicitly and is therefore NULL for most tasks: every base-relative guard in PR linking previously fell back to the project default, so a worktree cut from a long-lived integration branch was measured against the wrong branch (the unsoundness documented in [PR Integration](pr-integration.md)). Deliberately NOT a backfill of `base_branch`: `ensureTaskBranchCheckout` treats a NULL `base_branch` as "nothing to check out" and returns early, so populating that column would push non-worktree spawns into a fetch-and-checkout path they skip today, and into a guard that throws `BranchCheckoutBlockedError`. Cleared alongside `branch_name` by every cleanup path (`tests/unit/pushed-branch-cleanup-parity.test.ts`). No backfill: the resolution is gone by the time any consumer asks, so NULL correctly means "not recorded". Written only where the resolution is real: `createWorktree` reports `null` when it attached to a branch that already existed (no start point is passed, so the resolved base describes a cut that never happened), and `recordWorktree` omits the column rather than nulling it, so a later reuse cannot erase a base an earlier creation did record. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
62. **`pr_merge_readiness` column on tasks** - adds `pr_merge_readiness TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, the normalized merge-readiness verdict of the linked PR (`ready` / `blocked` / `conflicting` / `queued` / `running` / `unknown`, the `PRMergeReadiness` union): would a Merge click succeed right now, and if not, is a blocking check still in flight? Computed inside each PR connector from its own platform's mergeability fields (GitHub's `mergeStateStatus` / `mergeable` / `reviewDecision` / `statusCheckRollup` plus, behind `git.prBypassCountsAsReady`, the viewer's `viewerCanMergeAsAdmin` and the base branch's required checks; Azure's `mergeStatus` plus, behind `git.prEvaluateBranchPolicies`, its branch-policy evaluations) and never mapped outside `src/main/pr/adapters/`. Unlike `pr_state`, the value is VIEWER-RELATIVE: with the bypass setting on, a GitHub PR still waiting on a required review (`BLOCKED`, or `BEHIND` once a sibling PR lands) reads `ready` for a viewer whose bypass would merge it and `blocked` for one whose would not, so the same PR can legitimately hold different verdicts in two people's databases. The column is plain TEXT with no CHECK constraint, so the two in-flight values landed without a migration. Orthogonal to `pr_state`, which stays the gate for the terminal short-circuits. NULL means never judged (no PR, or a link that predates this column); `unknown` means the platform was asked and has no verdict yet. Preserved by a resolve whose tier cannot judge it (the commit tier on both providers), held through a pending `unknown` on a bounded re-poll, and cleared with the other three PR columns by every writer that nulls `pr_state` (see [PR Integration](pr-integration.md#where-pr-state-is-persisted)). No backfill: NULL correctly means "never judged", and the next sweep fills it. Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
63. **Subagent attribution columns on `conversation_turn_usage`** - adds `subagent_id`, `agent_type`, and `parent_tool_use_id` (`TEXT DEFAULT NULL`) plus `spawn_depth` (`INTEGER DEFAULT NULL`), and creates `idx_turn_usage_agent_type` on `(agent_type, ts)`. `subagent_id` is the discriminator: NULL for every main-thread (driver) turn, set for a turn a Task-tool subagent ran. Every row written before subagent capture existed is a main-thread turn, so NULL is also the correct historical value and no backfill is needed. The index serves the project-wide by-type rollup's `GROUP BY` ordering only. It does NOT prune on `subagent_id`, which is in no index, so that predicate still runs per row; the per-task breakdown rides the existing `idx_turn_usage_task` instead. See the `conversation_turn_usage` table section above for which readers see which rows. Four idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`s plus one idempotent `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`.
64. **`turn_spawn_links`** - adds the table that makes `parent_tool_use_id` resolvable, mapping a subagent-spawning tool call's id to the turn that emitted it, plus `idx_turn_spawn_links_turn` on `(turn_uuid)` for the reverse direction. Migration 63 stored the child's half of that link and nothing stored the parent's: `conversation_turn_usage.turn_uuid` is the transcript record's own uuid for a main-thread row and `sub:<subagentId>:<messageId>` for a subagent one, and neither is a tool-use id, so the column named a key no row carried. No backfill: links accrue as sessions are indexed, and a task with none reports its fan-outs under a null driver rather than losing them. One idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` plus one idempotent `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`.
65. **`remote_item_cache` table** - creates the persistent cache of remote board items for the Import dialog, keyed by `(external_source, repository, external_id)`. The dialog paints it instantly on open (`backlog:importGetCached`, no network) and reconciles only items changed since `MAX(remote_updated_at)` (`backlog:importReconcile`), so browsing a large tracker no longer re-fetches everything and no longer spawns one `az rest` per Azure DevOps work item just to render the list. `state_category` is the normalized `'open' | 'closed'` bucket, kept for a future SQL-level filter; the copy the dialog actually reads is `stateCategory` inside `payload`, which also carries `alreadyImported` forced false (re-stamped from the live backlog on read) and has Azure DevOps comments deferred to import time. See the `remote_item_cache table` section above. Idempotent `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`.
66. **`column_automations` and `automation_runs` tables, and the actions-to-automations data migration** - creates both tables and their four indices (see the table sections above), then converts what the old `actions` + `swimlane_transitions` pair held. Every transition row becomes a `column_automations` row on its `to` column, in `(from, to, execution_order)` order, with the action's name, type and config copied; an action referenced N times becomes N independent automations, because an automation belongs to exactly one column. Names are made unique per column BEFORE the unique index is created, or its creation fails. Three types are DROPPED rather than ported, rows and all: `kill_session` (at Priority 4 the task has no active session, so the seeded `* -> Planning` row did nothing), `create_worktree` (duplicates the move path's `ensureTaskWorktree`) and `cleanup_worktree` (duplicates what a To Do move does). The seeded "Start Planning Agent" is skipped too, since its prompt equals `DEFAULT_SPAWN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, which the fallback spawn already uses; a `spawn_agent` row with any OTHER prompt IS copied, as the one legacy automation. Every swimlane with a non-empty `auto_command` gains a `send_message` enter row carrying the message and its mode, and both swimlane fields are then cleared. `workingDir` is dropped from `run_script` configs. Idempotent via a `schema_meta` flag, so a second run is a no-op; `tests/unit/automations-migration.test.ts` pins each of those cases.

### Key Migrations (Global DB)

Listed in execution order (idempotent, gated on `IF NOT EXISTS` / `pragma table_info`):

1. **`project_groups` table** -- creates the project groups table for organizing projects into named, collapsible sections.
2. **`group_id` column on projects** -- adds nullable foreign key linking projects to their group.
3. **`position` column on projects** -- adds explicit project ordering. Backfills positions based on `last_opened DESC` order to preserve the original visual order.
4. **`default_model` and `default_effort` columns on projects** - adds `default_model TEXT` and `default_effort TEXT` (both nullable, no default). Per-project model/effort defaults mirroring the existing `default_agent`; unlike `default_agent`, NULL is a valid "no project preference" state that falls through to the CLI/agent default. Read at spawn time as the tier between a column's `model_override`/`effort_override` and the CLI default, but only when the agent the spawn resolves to equals `default_agent` - these ids are adapter-specific, so the project tier does not follow a task or column that overrides the agent (`projectModelDefaultsApply`). Idempotent guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
5. **`dev_ports` table** - creates the dev-server reservation ledger plus `idx_dev_ports_project` and a NON-unique `idx_dev_ports_task`, so one task can hold several ports. The migration also carries a guarded drop of an earlier UNIQUE index on `task_id`. That guard only ever fires against a database built by an intermediate commit of the same change (a developer's own preview, or a reviewer who ran the branch twice) - no RELEASED version carried the unique shape, so do not read the drop as evidence that shipped data does.

## Repository Pattern

One repository class per table. All queries are synchronous (better-sqlite3). Transactions are used for position shifts (task move, task reorder, swimlane reorder, project reorder) to ensure consistent ordering. Task move and task reorder differ: `move()` shifts positions arithmetically and can leave gaps (archiving never renumbers), while `reorderWithinSwimlane()` rewrites a swimlane's positions densely to 0..N-1 in one pass, healing any gaps in the column it touches.

### ProjectRepository

Operates on the global DB. Uses `getGlobalDb()` internally -- no constructor argument needed.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `list()` | All projects ordered by position ASC |
| `getById(id)` | Single project by ID |
| `create(input)` | Insert at position 0, shifting all existing projects down |
| `getLastOpened()` | Most recently opened project (by `last_opened` DESC) |
| `updateLastOpened(id)` | Set `last_opened` to now |
| `rename(id, name)` | Rename a project |
| `delete(id)` | Delete and reindex positions to keep them contiguous (0..N-1) |
| `reorder(ids)` | Set positions from the ordered array of IDs |

### TaskRepository

Operates on a per-project DB.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `list(swimlaneId?)` | Active (non-archived) tasks, optionally filtered by swimlane. Includes `attachment_count` via LEFT JOIN on `task_attachments`. |
| `getById(id)` | Single task by ID (includes `attachment_count`) |
| `getBySessionId(sessionId)` | Find the active (non-archived) task that owns a given PTY session |
| `getByDisplayId(displayId)` | Single task by its `#N` display id, archived or not |
| `getByBranchName(branchName)` | The active (non-archived) task owning a local branch, most recently updated first. Maps a branch back to a task with no live session |
| `listByPRNumber(prNumber)` | Every task, archived included, whose `pr_number` is the given number, newest `updated_at` first. The PR linker's inferred tiers read it to refuse a PR another task on the board already holds; archived rows count because a Done task keeps its link |
| `listByBranchOrPushedBranch(branchName)` | Every task, archived included, holding the name as its `branch_name` or its `pushed_branch`, newest first. The PR linker's remote-tip tier reads it to refuse a branch another task owns before any PR exists for it |
| `create(input)` | Insert at the end of the target swimlane (next position). Transactional: allocates a monotonic `display_id` from `project_meta` in the same transaction as the INSERT |
| `nextPositionInSwimlane(swimlaneId)` | The raw append position past everything in a swimlane, archived rows included. `create()`'s append anchor, and what MCP task placement resolves an out-of-range ordinal slot against |
| `update(input)` | Partial update -- only provided fields are changed |
| `recordWorktree(id, path, branch, folder, resolvedBaseBranch?)` | Transactional write of `worktree_path`, `branch_name` and the write-once `worktree_folder` together, clearing `worktree_skip_reason` in the same transaction. Separate statements would leave a crash window where the path is set and the folder is not, which a later Done move would turn into permanent loss. The 5th parameter carries `createWorktree`'s observed base into `resolved_base_branch`, and is OMITTED from the write rather than nulled when absent, so a reattach that cannot observe a base (the pre-existing-branch path reports none) never erases what an earlier real creation recorded |
| `setWorktreeFolder(id, folder)` | Record the worktree's directory name. Write-once: guarded on `worktree_folder IS NULL`, so a task's worktree can never be relocated by a later write |
| `setWorktreeSkipReason(id, reason)` | Record why the last spawn ran without a worktree (a `WorktreeSkipReason`), or null once it has one. Does NOT bump `updated_at`: spawn telemetry must not reorder the board |
| `recoverLegacyWorktreeFolder(taskId, worktreesRoot)` | For a pre-numeric-scheme task whose `worktree_path` was already cleared by a Done move, recover and persist its original directory name from the newest `sessions.cwd`. Accepts only a direct child of `worktreesRoot`, so a project that is itself checked out at a worktree path cannot claim the enclosing worktree's name |
| `move(input)` | Transactional move: shift positions in old and new swimlanes, update task |
| `reorderWithinSwimlane(swimlaneId, orderedTaskIds)` | Dense rewrite of one swimlane's task order to 0..N-1 in a single transaction. The write behind `kangentic_reorder_tasks` and `kangentic_move_task`'s same-column `position`. Unlike `move()`'s two-shift arithmetic it heals position gaps left by archiving; a stray id from another swimlane is a no-op (`swimlane_id` guard), and re-issuing the same order writes nothing (`position != ?` guard, so `updated_at` moves only on rows that actually shift) |
| `archive(id)` | Set `archived_at` to now (soft-delete for Done column) |
| `unarchive(id, targetSwimlaneId, position)` | Clear `archived_at`, move to target swimlane and position |
| `clearArchived(id)` | Clear `archived_at` WITHOUT moving the task. The exact inverse of `archive(id)`, used by `task-move`s move-out-of-Done path, which has already placed the row and would fight `move()`s sibling reordering if it re-ran the placement |
| `listArchived()` | All archived tasks ordered by `archived_at` DESC |
| `listArchivedPreview(limit)` | The newest `limit` archived tasks plus the total archived count; cheap hydration for the Done column (full list loads lazily via `listArchived`) |
| `countAll()` | Bare `COUNT(*)` over every task, active and archived. For a caller that needs only the number: `list()` materializes every row plus the attachment-count join just to take `.length` |
| `countArchived()` | Bare `COUNT(*)` over archived tasks, the `listArchived()` counterpart of `countAll()`. `kangentic_list_columns` and `kangentic_get_column_detail` call it to report the done column's completed count (`kangentic_board_summary` prints the same number from the `listArchived()` it already loads for its label tally). A project-wide count stands in for one lane's because `archive()` has a single caller, the move-to-Done branch in `ipc/handlers/task-move.ts`, which runs only once the task's `swimlane_id` is the `role = 'done'` lane |
| `delete(id)` | Hard delete with position shift in the owning swimlane |

### SwimlaneRepository

Operates on a per-project DB.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `list()` | All swimlanes ordered by position ASC. Maps integer columns to booleans (`is_archived`, `auto_spawn`). |
| `getById(id)` | Single swimlane by ID |
| `create(input)` | Insert before the `done` column (if any), otherwise at the end, shifting existing columns right. An explicit `position` is taken raw with no shift -- the caller (e.g. `handleCreateColumn`) is responsible for making room. |
| `update(input)` | Partial update -- only provided fields are changed |
| `reorder(ids)` | Set positions from ordered array. Enforces constraints: todo must be position 0, custom columns (role=null) cannot be position 0. |
| `delete(id)` | Delete a custom column. System columns (`todo`, `done`) cannot be deleted. Columns with tasks cannot be deleted. Also cleans up related transitions and dangling `plan_exit_target_id` references. |

### AutomationRepository

Operates on a per-project DB. Takes over from `ActionRepository`, whose IPC handlers were deleted.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `listAll()` | Every column's automations, which is what the renderer store holds |
| `listForColumn(columnId)` | One column's rows, both groups, ordered by trigger then position |
| `getForTrigger(columnId, trigger)` | That trigger's ENABLED rows in run order. The read the engine does on a move. |
| `replaceForColumn(columnId, automations)` | Whole-column delete-and-insert. `position` is assigned PER TRIGGER, so the two groups number from 0 independently and can never interleave. A supplied `id` is kept, so a row keeps its identity and its run history across an edit. |
| `deleteForColumn(columnId)` | Drop a column's rows. `SwimlaneRepository.delete` calls it explicitly, even though the foreign key cascades too. |

### AutomationRunRepository

Operates on a per-project DB.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `start(run)` | Write the `running` row before the attempt |
| `finish(id, status, detail, attempts)` | Close it on every exit path |
| `recordSkipped(run, reason)` | Write a row that opens and closes at once. A skip never ran, so it has no window to be interrupted in. |
| `recordDeliveredByCaller(run, detail)` | Write a `succeeded` row for a message the move delivered itself, in the same keystroke burst as its `/model` or `/effort` change, so the run log shows it like every other run. |
| `listForTask(taskId, limit)` | Everything that ran for one card, newest first |
| `listForAutomation(automationId, limit)` | Every run of one automation, newest first. Across ALL tasks: it answers "did my automation work", not "what happened to this card". |
| `markStaleRunsInterrupted(startedBefore)` | Stamp every row still `running` and started before this time as `interrupted`. Returns the count, so the caller raises ONE summary push rather than one per row. |
| `pruneTo(limit)` | Keep the newest N rows. Nothing else bounds the table. |

### ActionRepository (legacy, still present)

The reader and writer for `actions` and `swimlane_transitions`. Its IPC handlers are gone with the
`ACTION_*` and `TRANSITION_*` channels, which had zero renderer callers; `AUTOMATION_LIST` and
`AUTOMATION_REPLACE_FOR_COLUMN` took their place, and no move path reads these two tables any more.

The class itself is not deleted. Two callers remain: `apply-config.ts` still reconciles a
`kangentic.json` that carries the legacy `actions` and `transitions` keys, and
`automations-migration.ts` reads both tables once to convert them. A file written by an older build
therefore still round-trips, which is why `BoardConfig.actions` and `.transitions` became optional
rather than being removed.

### SessionRepository

Operates on a per-project DB.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `insert(record)` | Insert a new session record. Caller provides the `id` (PTY session ID = DB primary key, enabling unified session identity across the in-memory PTY layer and the database). |
| `updateStatus(id, status, extra?)` | Update session status with optional `exit_code`, `suspended_at`, `exited_at`, `suspended_by` |
| `getResumable()` | Get suspended agent sessions that can be resumed (any `session_type` except `run_script`) |
| `markAllRunningAsOrphaned()` | Mark all `running` sessions as `orphaned` (crash recovery on startup) |
| `markRunningAsOrphanedExcluding(excludeTaskIds)` | Same as above but skips sessions whose task_id is in the exclusion set (prevents HMR re-entrant recovery from orphaning active sessions) |
| `getOrphaned()` | Get orphaned agent sessions (any `session_type` except `run_script`) |
| `deleteByTaskId(taskId)` | Delete all session records for a given task |
| `getLatestForTask(taskId)` | Find the most recent session record for a task (by `started_at` DESC) |
| `listForTaskNewestFirst(taskId)` | All session records for a task, newest first. Used by `captureGitChurn` to enumerate the full record-id list for `setTaskGitStats`. |
| `getUserPausedTaskIds()` | Get task IDs whose latest session was user-paused (`suspended_by = 'user'`) |
| `listAllSessionIds()` | Get all distinct session record IDs (for stale session directory cleanup) |
| `updateGitStats(id, stats)` | Update `lines_added`, `lines_removed`, `files_changed` for a single session record, unconditionally. |
| `setTaskGitStats(recordIds, canonicalRecordId, stats)` | Mirrors `UsageHistoryRepository.setTaskGitStats`: writes churn to `canonicalRecordId` only and zeros every other id in `recordIds`, so `getSummaryForTask` / `listAllSummaries`'s `SUM(lines_added)` reflects the branch's actual churn instead of double-counting it across `--resume` records. |

### AttachmentRepository

Operates on a per-project DB. Manages both database records and files on disk under `<projectPath>/.kangentic/tasks/<taskId>/attachments/`.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `list(taskId)` | All attachments for a task ordered by `created_at` ASC |
| `getById(id)` | Single attachment by ID |
| `add(projectPath, taskId, filename, base64Data, mediaType)` | Decode base64 data, write file to disk, insert DB record. Filename is sanitized and prefixed with the attachment UUID. |
| `remove(id)` | Delete file from disk and DB record |
| `deleteByTaskId(taskId)` | Delete all attachments for a task (files + DB records). Attempts to clean up empty directories. |
| `getPathsForTask(taskId)` | Get file paths for all attachments on a task (for passing to Claude CLI) |
| `getDataUrl(id)` | Read file from disk and return as a `data:` URL with the correct media type |

### BacklogRepository

Operates on a per-project DB. Manages items in the Backlog View staging area.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `list()` | All backlog items ordered by position ASC |
| `getById(id)` | Single backlog item by ID |
| `create(input)` | Insert at the end (next position) |
| `update(input)` | Partial update - only provided fields are changed |
| `delete(id)` | Delete and shift positions to keep them contiguous |
| `reorder(ids)` | Set positions from ordered array of IDs |
| `bulkDelete(ids)` | Delete multiple items and reindex positions |
| `renameLabel(oldName, newName)` | Rename a label across all items |
| `deleteLabel(name)` | Remove a label from all items |
| `remapPriorities(mapping)` | Remap priority values across all items using a mapping |

### TranscriptRepository

Operates on a per-project DB. Manages ANSI-stripped session transcripts.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create(sessionId)` | Insert an empty transcript row for a new session (call before any data arrives so `appendChunk` has a row to update) |
| `appendChunk(sessionId, chunk)` | Append a chunk of ANSI-stripped text to the session's transcript via SQLite string concatenation |
| `getBySessionId(sessionId)` | Get the full transcript record for a session |
| `getTranscriptText(sessionId)` | Get just the transcript text for a session (lighter than `getBySessionId` when only the content is needed) |
| `getTranscriptTail(sessionId, maxChars)` | Get the last `maxChars` characters of a session's transcript plus its full length, computed in SQLite (`substr`) so a multi-MB transcript is not materialized in JS |
| `getSizeBytes(sessionId)` | Get the transcript size in bytes without loading the content |

### HandoffRepository

Operates on a per-project DB. Tracks cross-agent context handoffs.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `insert(record)` | Insert a new handoff record |
| `updateToSession(id, toSessionId)` | Update the target session ID after the handoff spawn completes |
| `listByTaskId(taskId)` | List all handoff records for a task (ordered by `created_at` ASC) |
| `getLatestForTask(taskId)` | Get the most recent handoff record for a task |
| `getByFromSession(sessionId)` | Forward lookup: where did this session's context go? |
| `getByToSession(sessionId)` | Backward lookup: where did this session's context come from? |

### BacklogAttachmentRepository

Operates on a per-project DB. Manages both database records and files on disk under `<projectPath>/.kangentic/backlog/<backlogTaskId>/attachments/`. Mirrors `AttachmentRepository` for backlog tasks.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `list(backlogTaskId)` | All attachments for a backlog task ordered by `created_at` ASC |
| `getById(id)` | Single attachment by ID |
| `add(projectPath, backlogTaskId, filename, base64Data, mediaType)` | Decode base64 data, write file to disk, insert DB record. Syncs `attachment_count` on the parent backlog task. |
| `remove(id)` | Delete file from disk and DB record. Syncs `attachment_count`. |
| `deleteByTaskId(backlogTaskId)` | Delete all attachments for a backlog task (files + DB records). Attempts to clean up empty directories. |
| `getPathsForTask(backlogTaskId)` | Get file paths for all attachments on a backlog task |
| `getDataUrl(id)` | Read file from disk and return as a `data:` URL with the correct media type |

### UsageHistoryRepository

Operates on a per-project DB. Append-only ledger of finalized session usage. Decoupled from `sessions` and `tasks` so lifetime cost and token totals survive task deletion, bulk-archive, and revert-to-backlog.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `recordSessionUsage(input)` | Insert or UPSERT a history row keyed by `session_record_id`. UPSERT updates cost / tokens / duration / tool count / model / compaction-count fields on conflict but intentionally excludes git stat columns from the `DO UPDATE SET` clause (those are owned by `setTaskGitStats`). Called from `captureSessionMetrics` whenever `usage` is defined - including subscription-user sessions where `cost = 0` with real token counts. Token columns here hold the per-capture SNAPSHOT (not the transcript cumulative), so period stats summed across a session's `--resume` rows do not double-count. |
| `updateGitStats(sessionRecordId, stats)` | Update `lines_added`, `lines_removed`, `files_changed` for a single history row, unconditionally. Silent no-op if no row exists for the given `sessionRecordId`. Superseded as the churn-write entry point by `setTaskGitStats` below; kept as the low-level single-row primitive. |
| `setTaskGitStats(recordIds, canonicalRecordId, stats)` | Write git churn to exactly ONE row per task lineage: `canonicalRecordId` gets `stats`, every other id in `recordIds` is zeroed. Called from `captureGitChurn` in `src/main/ipc/handlers/git-stats-capture.ts`, fired on every session finalization (suspend, move, handoff, respawn, natural exit) - not just move-to-Done - alongside the matching `SessionRepository.setTaskGitStats` call. Prevents the dashboard's flat SUM from double-counting a branch's cumulative churn across `--resume` records; a canonical row with no history entry (`changes === 0`) leaves siblings untouched rather than zeroing a real earlier capture. |
| `getUsageTotals(since, until?)` | One-row SUM/COUNT/MIN/MAX aggregate over the `[since, until)` window (pass `null` since for "All Time"). Feeds the dashboard KPI totals, previous-period deltas, and per-project summaries. All read queries here filter on `session_started_at` (when work happened), not `recorded_at` (when metrics flushed), so Today/Week/Month semantics are preserved across midnight boundaries. |
| `listUsageRollup(since, until?)` | `GROUP BY (model_id, model_display_name, agent, effort)` rollup over the window, ordered by each combo's earliest session. Feeds the by-model / by-agent / by-effort breakdowns (base-model-id merging stays in JS over O(dimension-combos) rows). |
| `listUsageCostGroups(since, until, groupMs)` | Window rows grouped to fixed UTC buckets of `groupMs` (15 minutes) per model - the cost-series input, folded to local chart buckets by `src/main/usage-stats/bucketing.ts`. |
| `countSessionsRepresented(since, until, ids)` | COUNT of the given `session_record_id`s already in the window's ledger - the live-session dedup for the SESSIONS KPI. |

The aggregation is pushed into SQL (replacing the old raw-row `listRowsAfter` + JS fold) so the synchronous main-process JS work is O(buckets), not O(historical rows); the remaining folds live in the pure functions of `src/main/usage-stats/bucketing.ts`, consumed by the `USAGE_GET_DASHBOARD_STATS` IPC handler and the `kangentic_get_usage_stats` MCP tool via `usageStatsService`.

### DevPortRepository

Operates on the global DB (`getGlobalDb()`), like `ProjectRepository`. Deliberately
narrow: every method has a live caller, and reads this table could support but
nothing asks for are left unwritten rather than kept warm.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `listForTask(taskId)` | Every port a task holds, lowest first |
| `getByTaskId(taskId)` | The task's lowest-numbered reservation, or null (what `{{port}}` resolves to) |
| `getByPort(port)` | The reservation on a port, or null |
| `claim(port, projectId, taskId)` | `INSERT OR IGNORE`; false when the port was taken between the caller's probe and this write, so a racing allocator retries the next candidate instead of throwing |
| `releaseByTaskId(taskId)` | Release every port a task holds |

Project removal releases that project's ports too, but does so with raw SQL inside
`ProjectRepository.delete`'s transaction (both tables live in the global DB and the
delete has to be atomic with it), so there is deliberately no `releaseForProject`
here.

Every method above **fails soft**: if the global database cannot be opened, each
returns its empty answer (`[]`, `null`, `false`) and logs once, rather than
throwing. That is a design property, not a convenience. This table is in the
GLOBAL database while its callers are per-project TASK paths - resolving
`{{port}}`, deleting a task - so a throw here would take an unrelated task
operation down with it. A row is advisory anyway (the bind probe is the
authority), so "the ledger is unreachable" correctly reads as "this task holds
no reservations".

## Connection Management

- `getGlobalDb()` -- singleton, created on first access.
- `getProjectDb(projectId)` -- cached per project ID, reused across the app lifecycle.
- `closeProjectDb(projectId)` -- close and remove from cache on project delete.
- `closeAll()` -- close all connections on app shutdown.

## Default Seed Data

New projects are seeded with 7 default swimlanes:

1. **To Do** (role: `todo`)
2. **Planning**
3. **Executing**
4. **Code Review**
5. **Testing**
6. **Merge**
7. **Done** (role: `done`, seeded `is_archived = 1`)

Done is the one lane seeded archived, and that is structural rather than a user choice: the board
renders it as the collapsed `DoneSwimlane` instead of a normal column, and `apply-config.ts` forces
the flag back on for the `done` role on every board-config apply. Anything that filters swimlanes on
`is_archived` therefore drops Done unless it carves the role out, which is why the MCP read tools
have explicit done-column handling. See
[mcp-server.md](mcp-server.md#kangentic_list_columns).

No lane is seeded with a `description`: it is left empty for the user to fill in, because a
`description` round-trips into the project's committed `kangentic.json` and a prefilled one would
land in every user's repo. The seed is bound to the UI tier's mock copy by
`tests/unit/default-swimlanes-seed-parity.test.ts`.

**No automations are seeded either, and no actions or transitions.** A fresh board starts with an
empty automations list on every column, which is also how the old seed behaved: each of the three
rows it created was a no-op or a duplicate of the move path. Kill Session found no active session
at Priority 4, and Start Planning Agent carried exactly the prompt template the fallback spawn
already uses. `seedActionsAndTransitions` and `seedDefaultActions` are gone with them.

Planning still opens its agent in plan mode. That comes from the column's own `permission_mode`,
not from a seeded row.
