# Developer Guide

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.12+ (vitest 5 declares `^22.12.0 || ^24.0.0 || >=26.0.0`, so 22.0 through 22.11 cannot run the unit tier)
- Git 2.25+ (worktree support)
- Platform-specific:
  - **Windows:** Visual Studio Build Tools (for better-sqlite3 native compilation)
  - **macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux:** `build-essential`, `python3`

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts Vite (renderer HMR), esbuild (main/preload watch), and launches Electron.

## Build System

### Development (`npm run dev` / `scripts/dev.js`)

Three parallel processes:

1. **Vite dev server** -- serves renderer with HMR on port 5173 (5174+ in worktrees)
2. **esbuild watch** -- bundles `src/main/index.ts` → `.vite/build/index.js`, `src/preload/preload.ts` → `.vite/build/preload.js`, and the three `utilityProcess` worker entries as their own bundles next to the main bundle: `src/main/retrieval/embedder/embed-worker.ts`, `src/main/git/line-count/line-count-worker.ts`, and `src/main/transcription/dictation-worker.ts` (the dictation engine - see `.claude/rules/dictation-out-of-process.md`)
3. **Electron** -- launched with `MAIN_WINDOW_VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` pointing to Vite

The esbuild externals (`better-sqlite3`, `node-pty`, `sherpa-onnx-node`, `sqlite-vec`, `@huggingface/transformers`, `font-list`, plus `electron` itself) are not bundled. They load at runtime from `node_modules`. The list is declared identically in `scripts/build.js` and `scripts/dev.js`, so change one and change the other. Everything else, `simple-git` included, is bundled. Getting an external into a packaged build is a separate question, covered under Packaging below.

Flags:
- `--port=<n>` - override Vite port
- `--ephemeral` - isolated data directory, auto-cleaned on exit (used for worktree previews). The data directory is wiped on every boot, so a previous (possibly crashed) preview's clones never persist. Because the wipe also takes the markers that say what the user has already seen, the boot seeds them back: `hasCompletedFirstRun`, `lastWhatsNewShownVersion`, and every announcement in the committed `announcements.json` stamped read and dismissed. Without that last one the megaphone badge and the announcement banner returned on every preview launch.
- `--fresh` - ephemeral preview with NO project pre-cloned or auto-opened, so the app starts on the Welcome Screen. Use it to exercise the first-launch experience (pick a folder, land on the board, onboarding checklist). Implies the same wipe as `--ephemeral`, but deliberately gets NONE of the seeded markers above, so onboarding, What's New, and unread announcements all present as they would to a real first-time user.

**Single-instance lock warning:** a non-ephemeral launch whose Electron process exits almost immediately with code 0 means another Kangentic instance (usually the installed app) already holds the single-instance lock -- the loser exits silently and the holder's window is focused, which looks exactly like a successful dev launch while you are actually using the other build. `dev.js` detects that signature (non-ephemeral, exit 0, under 5s from spawn) and prints an unmissable warning: quit the other instance (including its tray icon and any background processes in Task Manager), then run `npm start` again. Ephemeral previews skip the lock and can never trigger it.

**Dev build marker:** a dev build names itself `Kangentic (dev)` in the title-bar wordmark and in the OS window title, so a dogfooding `npm start` window is tellable from a packaged build in the taskbar without clicking into it. Both strings are gated on the build-time `__KANGENTIC_DEV__` flag and are dead-code-eliminated from a production build. A worktree preview is a dev window, so it gains the wordmark suffix on top of its preview pill, while its own `#<id> - <title>` label still wins the OS title. The two marketing captures (`walkthrough.capture.ts`, `agent-orchestration.capture.ts`) render against the Vite dev server, where the flag is true, so `hideDevOnlyChrome` in `tests/captures/helpers/capture-page.ts` hides the badge; a capture entry point that forgets the call fails `tests/unit/capture-dev-chrome-parity.test.ts`. The scene captures (`scenes.capture.ts`) render against the built demo, which has no badge, and call it only to satisfy that test.

### Production (`npm run build` / `scripts/build.js`)

0. Sets `NODE_ENV=production` and prints whether the Sentry symbol upload is enabled or skipped.
   Both are load-bearing. The Sentry bundler plugins skip their upload when `NODE_ENV` is
   `development` and say so only at debug level, and printing nothing at all when the token was
   absent is how two releases shipped with unreadable stacks.
1. `tsc --noEmit` (type check)
2. Vite builds renderer → `.vite/build/renderer/main_window/`
3. esbuild bundles main + preload + the three utility-process workers (embed, line-count, dictation), minified
4. Copies bridge scripts (`status-bridge.js`, `event-bridge.js`) to `.vite/build/`
5. Uploads node-pty's shipped Windows PDBs to Sentry as debug files (`uploadNativeDebugFiles`):
   Windows leg only, gated on a `KANGENTIC_SENTRY_TOKEN` / `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` upload token. A
   missing token is a no-op; with a token present, a failed upload FAILS the build rather than
   warning past it.

### Web demo (`npm run build:demo` / `demo/vite.config.mts`)

The renderer built for a plain browser, so the site and the docs can embed the actual app. A
second Vite invocation, never a second entry in the shared config: it reuses `vite.config.mts` as
a factory, forces production semantics (`__KANGENTIC_DEV__` false, the Sentry plugins dropped by
name, no sourcemaps), and writes `dist/demo/`, which is gitignored and outside every packaging
glob. One plugin injects five classic scripts ahead of the module bundle: the scene registry, the
boot script (`demo/boot.js`: the URL contract, config overrides, still and embed styles, the
hand-over to `demo/stage.html` that hosts a direct visit at the site's 1600 by 1000, the
pre-reveal step runner, and a silent microphone in place of `getUserMedia`), the webview shim
(`demo/webview-shim.js`: an iframe standing in for Electron's `<webview>` in the Browser pane,
onto a bundled copy of what the project renders at its dev URL), `tests/ui/mock-electron-api.js`
verbatim, and the generated seed (the sample install from `tests/captures/helpers/demo-dataset.ts`
plus, per recording under `tests/captures/fixtures/demo/`, its opening and final terminal frames,
its working-tree diff split into the three scopes, the last output peek its Monitor row shows and,
for a working session, how that peek changes over the recording, the agent message trail a board
card prints under the default Card Preview, and the scaffolded project's git history, blame, and
per-commit diffs from `tests/captures/fixtures/demo/history/`, captured by
`scripts/capture-demo-history.mjs` from the repo `scripts/lib/demo-scaffold-repo.mjs` builds
out of the scaffold's `commits.json`). The
plugin also emits every
recording's timed byte stream under `recordings/`, which the live frame fetches when a terminal
mounts to replay the session as it happened, and the agent boots a drag or a new Command
Terminal starts (recorded per task and per project by `scripts/capture-demo-sessions.mjs` from
the dataset), plus the agent transcript behind a session under `transcripts/` (from
`tests/captures/fixtures/demo/transcripts/`, derived by main's own parsers), which the
conversation viewer fetches when it opens. The five scripts, the recordings, the transcripts, and the guest pages carry a content hash in their
names, as Vite's own chunks do, so a copy GitHub Pages cached from an earlier release is never
paired with a new seed. Beside them it emits `scenes.json` unhashed: the scene list (name, reach, the alt text a
docs figure carries, the maintainer description), the frame size (1600 by 1000), and the app
version, generated from the same registry the page boots, which is what kangentic.com reads at
build time to embed a scene by name. `--base=<path>` on the CLI
moves the base path; the GitHub Pages deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml`, called from
the release graph after `publish-release`) builds with `--base=/kangentic/`. `demo/README.md`
documents the URL contract, the scenes, the numbers, and the Electron-only surfaces that stay
inert in a browser.

The scene registry (`tests/captures/scenes.ts`) has a second consumer: `npm run capture` builds
the demo, then `tests/captures/features/scenes.capture.ts` opens every scene in it by URL and
screenshots it per theme into the gitignored `captures/<timestamp>/scenes/`, playing the gesture
a `driver` scene needs (a held drag, a right-click) with Playwright. The rig has no scene applier
of its own; `demo/boot.js` is the applier for both consumers.

### Worktree Dev

In worktrees, `dev.js` bypasses `vite.config.mts` and creates an inline Vite config. This avoids pattern-matching issues where `.kangentic/**` in the watch ignore would match the worktree's own path. It also gives worktree servers an isolated Vite dep cache (`<worktree>/.kangentic/vite-cache`; `vite.config.mts` uses `.kangentic/vite-cache-tests` when loaded from a worktree, e.g. Playwright's webServer), because the worktree's `node_modules` is a junction to the main repo's, and sharing the default `node_modules/.vite` would let a worktree server boot invalidate the running main server's cache and break its dynamic imports.

`scripts/worktree-preview.js` creates a `node_modules` junction/symlink from the worktree to the repo root, then opens a native terminal running the dev server. `--env KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) sets a variable in that dev server's environment by splicing it into the terminal command: the tab the launcher opens inherits the terminal host's environment, not the launcher's, so a variable set on the launcher's own process never reaches `dev.js`. Values may not contain quotes, newlines, or `& | < > ^ %`, and the command is visible in the process list, so it must not carry a secret. `tests/unit/worktree-preview-env.test.ts` pins the cmd.exe and POSIX quoting.

`node scripts/worktree-preview.js --stop --port=<port>` writes a stop file; `dev.js` then asks Electron to quit through the dev inspection bridge (`POST /quit`) so the app runs its real quit path (sessions suspended, PTYs killed, the run recorded as a clean exit), and kills it only if that has not finished within 8s. Once Electron is gone nothing holds the two repo clones under `.kangentic/data`, so the ephemeral removal actually runs and takes ten seconds or more on Windows; the launcher waits up to 45s for the dev server to exit before force-killing.

`node scripts/worktree-preview.js --wait --port=<port>` blocks until that preview exits, then exits with a code that says why: `0` clean (terminal closed or `--stop`), `1` watcher usage/setup error, `2` crashed (dev server exited non-zero), `3` vanished (force-killed with no recorded exit). `dev.js`'s `cleanup()` writes a small `{ pid, exitCode }` record under `os.tmpdir()` (see `scripts/preview-exit-record.js`) as its first statement, since ephemeral mode removes the whole worktree `.kangentic/` directory on exit and nothing under the worktree would otherwise survive to tell the watcher how the server exited. The `/preview` skill runs this backgrounded by default so the harness delivers a task-notification when the preview exits.

## Testing

Three tiers. Use the right one for the job.

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

- **Runner:** Vitest
- **Speed:** Sub-second
- **What to test here:** Pure logic -- parsers, filters, state machines, utility functions
- **No build needed**, no browser, no Electron

### UI Tests (`tests/ui/`)

```bash
npx playwright test --project=ui
```

- **Runner:** Playwright with headless Chromium
- **Speed:** ~13s for 72 tests
- **What to test here:** React components, forms, dialogs, drag-and-drop, board interactions
- **No build needed** -- runs against Vite dev server (auto-started by Playwright)
- **Mock:** `tests/ui/mock-electron-api.js` injects a full in-memory mock of `window.electronAPI` via `addInitScript()`. Supports full CRUD for projects, tasks, swimlanes, actions, sessions, config, attachments.
- **Pre-configure:** `window.__mockPreConfigure(fn)` lets tests set up mock state before React mounts

### E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/`)

```bash
npm run build
npx playwright test --project=electron
```

- **Runner:** Playwright with `_electron.launch()`
- **Speed:** Slower, opens real windows (no headless mode on Windows). `workers` is 1 on
  Windows/local (concurrent `electron.launch()` is flaky there); CI runs the tier on Linux/xvfb at
  `workers: 8`, sharded, with node_modules caching and the `closeApp()` teardown helper (see
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `playwright.config.ts`).
- **What to test here:** PTY sessions, terminal rendering, session lifecycle, shell detection, config persistence
- **Build required** before running
- **Boot reuse (opt-in):** a spec that uses the canonical default config and never relaunches
  Electron can import `{ test, expect }` from `./shared-app` instead of `@playwright/test` to
  share one worker-scoped Electron boot. See the header of `tests/e2e/shared-app.ts` for the
  eligibility and never-migrate lists.
- **Leak janitor:** a worker crash bypasses per-fixture teardown and leaves the launched Electron
  app (main plus its GPU and network-utility children) running with a dead parent, pinning the
  worktree's `node_modules`. `tests/e2e/electron-janitor.ts` is wired into Playwright `globalSetup`
  and `globalTeardown` (`playwright.config.ts`) to sweep these. It is conservative: a process is
  killed only when its command line points at the repo's `.kangentic/worktrees/` or the main
  checkout's `.vite/build/index.js` AND its parent is dead, so the dogfooding `npm start` app, any
  `/preview` window, and concurrent runs in other worktrees are never touched. "Parent is dead" is
  resolved against the COMPLETE liveness scan (`scanLivePids`, every process image), not the
  electron/node-only matching scan, so a concurrent worktree's live app whose supervising parent is
  a non-enumerated image is not mistaken for an orphan and reaped mid-test (bug #258); if that
  liveness scan returns nothing the sweep aborts rather than treat every process as orphaned. Every
  kill is logged under the `[E2E-JANITOR]` prefix with PID, parent PID, reason, and a command-line
  excerpt. The pure matching predicate is unit-tested in `tests/unit/e2e-janitor.test.ts`; the
  janitor reuses the scan and kill primitives from `src/main/git/zombie-reaper.ts`.

### Demo smoke (`tests/demo/`)

```bash
npm run build:demo
npm run test:demo
```

- **Runner:** Playwright with headless Chromium, one worker, against `dist/demo/` served by
  `demo/static-server.mjs` from `beforeAll` (deliberately not a `webServer` entry, which would
  start for every project filter and break the UI tier whenever the build is absent)
- **What it asserts:** every bootable scene in the registry reaches its `ready` element (the
  loop iterates `SCENES`, so a new entry is covered with no test change) and, where it names a
  `focus`, that element is a real region rather than nothing, an empty box, or the whole frame; a
  `driver` scene is refused by name, `scenes.json` is served and matches the registry, the ready
  message carries a dialog scene's focus rect, `embed=1` hides the window controls, `theme=`
  applies, an unknown
  scene shows the error card, the console stays clean, and boot makes no request off the serving
  origin
- **Build required** before running; the `demo` CI job and the Pages deploy both run it on the
  exact bytes they ship

### Decision Guide

| What you're testing | Tier |
|---------------------|------|
| Pure function, parser, utility | Unit |
| Component rendering, user interaction, form validation | UI |
| Real IPC, PTY spawning, terminal output, file I/O | E2E |
| The web build boots and stays embeddable | Demo smoke |

Release-time manual validation against real authenticated agent CLIs lives in [release-checklist.md](release-checklist.md). Automated tests use mock fixtures and intentionally do not exercise real model latency, real tool calls, or conversation continuity across resume.

### Run All

The `/test` command is the full local gate: typecheck, build, then unit + UI + E2E (all tests,
no selection heuristic). `/test quick` runs unit + UI only for the fast inner loop. It is for
manual local runs - the automated gate now runs on CI as PR checks (the **Testing** column runs
`/pull-request`, which pushes a branch and drives the CI checks to green; CI runs lint, typecheck,
unit, build, the UI shards, and the Linux Electron E2E shards under xvfb). To run tiers directly:

```bash
npx playwright test              # UI + E2E
npm run test:unit                 # Unit (separate runner)
```

## Adding Features

### New IPC Channel

1. Add channel constant to `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts`
2. Add handler in the appropriate `src/main/ipc/handlers/*.ts` module
3. Add method to `ElectronAPI` interface in `src/shared/types.ts`
4. Add bridge method in `src/preload/preload.ts`
5. Call from renderer via `window.electronAPI.domain.method()`
6. Extend `tests/ui/mock-electron-api.js` if UI tests need it

### New Zustand Store

1. Create `src/renderer/stores/my-store.ts`
2. Use `create<State>()` pattern
3. Bridge to IPC in actions: `const result = await window.electronAPI.domain.method()`
4. Import in components: `const value = useMyStore(s => s.value)`

### New Component

1. Add to appropriate `src/renderer/components/` subdirectory
2. Use `data-testid` attributes for test selectors
3. Use Lucide React for icons (no inline SVGs)
4. Dialogs: use `useEffect` Escape key listener

### New Test

- Pure logic → `tests/unit/`
- UI interaction → `tests/ui/`
- Needs real Electron backend → `tests/e2e/`

## Conventions

- **TypeScript strict mode** -- `noImplicitAny` enabled
- **No `any` types** -- use proper types from `src/shared/types.ts`, `unknown` with type guards, or generic constraints
- **Icons** -- Lucide React only, no inline SVGs
- **Test selectors** -- `data-testid` and `data-swimlane-name` attributes
- **Escape key** -- all dialogs use global `useEffect` listener
- **IPC channels** -- `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts` is the single source of truth
- **Dependency blocks** - `dependencies` is at most the esbuild externals (minus `electron`) plus whatever `electron-builder.yml`'s `files:` names directly. Every external except `electron` has to be there; the `files:` half is a permission, not a requirement, since most of what it names arrives transitively and carries no root declaration. Everything else is bundled and belongs in `devDependencies`. electron-builder copies the whole production closure into the asar, so a stray entry there ships its entire transitive tree for nothing. See `.claude/rules/dependency-block-parity.md`
- **`allowScripts`** - the block at the bottom of `package.json` is live npm 12 config, not leftovers from a tool nobody uses. npm blocks a dependency's install script unless `allowScripts` covers it, so deleting the key leaves `npm ci` exiting 0 with no electron binary and an uncompiled better-sqlite3. `npm install-scripts ls` shows what npm is blocking; `tests/unit/allow-scripts-coverage.test.ts` fails when a package with an install script is not covered
- **Lockfile metadata** - never regenerate `package-lock.json` against a populated `node_modules`. npm writes every already-installed package with no `resolved` and no `integrity`, which drops `npm ci`'s supply-chain verification for most of the tree without failing anything. `npm install --package-lock-only` does not repair it; `node scripts/repair-lockfile-integrity.js` does, and `tests/unit/lockfile-integrity.test.ts` fails CI when an entry is missing either field

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Context | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `KANGENTIC_DATA_DIR` | Runtime/Test | Override per-project data directory path |
| `VITE_PORT` | Dev | Explicit Vite port (enables external server reuse) |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_VITE_PORT` | Test | Port passed to Playwright's webServer |
| `HEADED` | Test | Set to `1` for visible Electron windows in E2E |
| `NODE_ENV` | Build | `development` or `production` |
| `MAIN_WINDOW_VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` | Dev | Injected by esbuild, points Electron to Vite |
| `MAIN_WINDOW_VITE_NAME` | Build | Renderer output directory name (`main_window`) |

## Documentation Maintenance

Run `/sync-docs` to review and update documentation after code changes. This command:
- Maps changed source files to affected docs using the source-to-doc mapping in `.claude/skills/sync-docs/SKILL.md`
- Checks for stale facts (schema, config keys, constants, types)
- Updates docs in-place and reports what changed

The targeted doc-anchor check runs automatically inside `/pull-request` (commit time),
`/merge-pull-request` (merge time), and `/merge-back` (direct push). To run the full review
manually: `/sync-docs`.

## Packaging

electron-builder handles platform-specific packaging via `electron-builder.yml`:

| Platform | Format | Builder |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Windows | Installer | NSIS |
| macOS | Disk image + ZIP | DMG |
| Linux | Package | deb, rpm |

Native modules:
- `better-sqlite3` - rebuilt against Electron headers via `scripts/rebuild-native.js`
- `node-pty` - uses prebuilt NAPI binaries, no rebuild needed
- `sherpa-onnx-node` - prebuilt platform-specific binaries, no rebuild needed (voice dictation, running in its own `kangentic-dictation` utilityProcess worker - see DESKTOP-X in `.claude/rules/dictation-out-of-process.md`; unpacked from asar via the `sherpa-onnx-*` glob in `asarUnpack`)
- `font-list` - shells out to `fc-list` / a PowerShell script / a bundled macOS binary, no rebuild needed (Terminal Font Family picker; unpacked from asar via `asarUnpack` since the macOS binary is spawned via `child_process`)
- `sqlite-vec` - a loadable SQLite extension shipped as per-platform binary packages, no rebuild needed (conversation-memory retrieval; unpacked via the `sqlite-vec-*` glob in `asarUnpack`, since dlopen cannot read an extension inside asar)
- `onnxruntime-node` - prebuilt native binaries (`onnxruntime_binding.node`, plus `onnxruntime.dll` and `DirectML.dll` on Windows), no rebuild needed (the embed worker's execution provider; unpacked via `asarUnpack`)
- `@huggingface/transformers` and `onnxruntime-web` - pure JavaScript, but both shipped and unpacked so the embed worker resolves them from the unpacked tree
- `onnxruntime-common`, `sharp` (with its `@img/*` platform binding), `detect-libc`, `semver` - what transformers.js requires at module scope; unpacked for the same reason, since the worker never looks inside the asar. `build/afterPack.js` loads the worker's externals from the unpacked tree after packing and fails the build if any of this closure is missing (`build/verify-unpacked-worker.js`)
- `bindings` and `file-uri-to-path` - pure JavaScript, and better-sqlite3's own transitive closure rather than anything this app imports. They carry a root `dependencies` entry only because `electron-builder.yml`'s `files:` names them directly, which is what `.claude/rules/dependency-block-parity.md` keeps them in that block for

Security fuses enabled: no RunAsNode, no NodeOptions, no inspection, cookie encryption, ASAR integrity validation.
