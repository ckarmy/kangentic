 * normalizePathsIntegration rewrites stack-frame paths and URLs relative to
 * the app root (so the user's home directory never reaches Sentry for app
 * code), sendDefaultPii stays false, and Sentry's server-side data scrubbing
 * is on by default. Any further scrubbing rule belongs in the Sentry UI
 * (Advanced Data Scrubbing), not in a custom beforeSend here.
 *
 * FILTERING is a separate concern and does live here, in `ignoreErrors`:
 * deciding that a whole class of event is un-actionable and should never become
 * an issue is a product judgement about our own code, not a data-privacy rule.
 * See the annotated entries below.
 *
 * NATIVE CRASH EVENTS are the one exception to "filtering lives in
 * `ignoreErrors`", and to the no-beforeSend stance above. `ignoreErrors` is the
 * `eventFiltersIntegration`, which matches only an event's message and its
 * exception type and value. A minidump event has none of those, so the matcher
 * sees an empty candidate list and the filter is a no-op on it. The thing that
 * says whether the crash was even ours lives in the attached dump, not on the
 * event, and Sentry derives the stack and the image list from that dump only
 * AFTER upload. So this one class is filtered in `beforeSend`
 * (filterNativeCrashEvent, above), which is the only hook that can see the
 * attachment. It is still filtering, not scrubbing: the scrubbing stance is
 * unchanged.
 *
 * Errors only: release-health session tracking (the MainProcessSession
 * integration, on by default) is filtered out, and tracing/replay are never
 * enabled. Aptabase's app_error stays as the coarse error-rate pulse on the
 * product dashboard; Sentry is the diagnostic tool.
