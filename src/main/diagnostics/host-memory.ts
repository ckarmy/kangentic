/**
 * Host-level memory pressure sampling (Sentry DESKTOP-16).
 *
 * DESKTOP-16 was a renderer OOM where the crashing renderer held 179 MB
 * (smaller than a healthy long-running dogfood session) while the HOST had
 * 2.15 MB of Windows commit charge left out of an 89.8 GB limit, with 4.66 GB
 * of physical RAM still free. That is commit exhaustion, not a renderer leak
 * or physical RAM exhaustion: the OS refused an ordinary 6.9 MB allocation
 * because the machine's pagefile-backed commit charge was fully spent, and
 * Kangentic had no visibility into that dimension at all. An `os.freemem()`
 * style check would not have caught it, since physical memory was fine.
 *
 * `process.getSystemMemoryInfo()`'s `swapTotal` / `swapFree` map DIRECTLY onto
 * the Windows commit limit / commit remaining, confirmed empirically
 * (2026-09-16): reading it against `Win32_OperatingSystem`'s
 * `TotalVirtualMemorySize` / `FreeVirtualMemory` on the same machine at the
 * same moment matched (73.14 GB / ~15 GB on both sides). This holds despite
 * the "swap" naming: on Windows, Chromium passes `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`'s
 * `ullTotalPageFile` / `ullAvailPageFile` straight through, which ARE the
 * commit figures, not merely the pagefile's on-disk size. Linux reports real
 * swap through the same fields, a different resource with no equivalent hard
 * OOM cliff, so this module reports a commit reading on win32 only and stays
 * null everywhere else rather than asserting an unverified mapping.
