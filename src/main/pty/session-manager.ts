   * jiggle each: the adapter's first-output latch (which a shell preamble

   * tripped first-output ~80ms after spawn, the fit resize then read as
   * post-first-output and never armed under the old criterion, and the
   * agent booting seconds later composed at the spawn width all turn.
   *
   * The re-assert is a jiggle - cols-1, then cols back - because a same-dims
   * delivery can be deduplicated anywhere in the chain (our own resize() would
   * noop it, and ConPTY/terminals may too); two genuine changes cannot. It
   * calls `session.pty.resize()` directly, NOT this.resize(): the ladder's
   * same-dims short-circuit would eat the restore leg, and its side effects
   * (pty-resize broadcasts burning the renderer's echo re-assert budget and
   * re-seeding phone frames, bufferManager.onResize stacking a repaint-settle
   * upgrade) are churn for a net-unchanged geometry that was already clamped
   * and policy-approved when it was first applied. cols-1 rather than cols+1
   * so the transient never exceeds the mounted xterm's grid. Back-to-back legs
   * are safe even if the chain coalesces them: the coalesced final size still
   * differs from the child's stale belief.
   *
   * Unconditional across platforms on purpose: the lost-resize window is
   * ConPTY-specific (a POSIX pty's winsize is kernel state the child reads at
   * TUI init), but on POSIX the jiggle costs only one extra SIGWINCH repaint
   * at first output, and one ungated code path means CI's Linux unit tests
