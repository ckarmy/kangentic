   *     from the task's session history by `recoverLegacyWorktreeFolder`) and
   *     every one created after it.
   *   - `worktree_folder` null: the folder is `String(display_id)`, and the

   * Remove a worktree directory. Returns false when the directory could not be
   * removed (file handles still held) so the caller leaves `worktree_path` set
   * for the next project-open retry pass.
   *
   * Steps, in order:
   *   1. Clear the worktree's node_modules (junction-safe; never traverses into
   *      a junction's target, so the main repo's node_modules is protected) and
   *      run `git worktree remove --force`, falling back to manual recursive rm.
   *   2. ONLY IF step 1 failed: reap orphaned processes pinning this worktree
   *      (zombie Electron/node left by E2E `_electron.launch()` or `/preview`)
   *      and retry step 1 once.
   *
   * The process reap is LAZY by design: a clean Done-move (no pinning orphan,
   * the overwhelming common case) never runs the OS process scan, so dragging a
   * task to Done pays zero added cost. The scan only fires on the rare delete
   * that a held handle actually blocks, where it is the cheapest way to unstick
   * the directory instead of leaving a husk. It is skipped entirely under
   * `NODE_ENV=test`: E2E owns its own leaked-process sweep (the janitor), and a
   * test's apps are parented by the Playwright worker anyway.
   *
   * `options.timeoutMs` caps each git call. `options.removalProfile` (default
   * `thorough`) tunes the retry budget; `moderate` makes a still-pinned path
   * fail in seconds instead of grinding for minutes while it holds the queue. A
   * false return is not a dead end: the caller logs a partial-delete warning and
   * leaves `worktree_path` set, so the directory is reused as an empty husk on
   * the next `createWorktree` (see `ensureWorktree`) and/or removed by the
   * startup retry pass (`retryFailedDoneCleanups`).
