/**
 * Enumerate worktrees across one project or every registered project.
 * Each worktree record carries its branch, dirty state, and commit delta
 * vs. the base branch its work is based on (falling back to its tracked
 * upstream only when no base is known) - enough for an agent to find a
 * task's branch, locate dirty work, or tell whether its tree is behind the
 * base it was cut from.
 *
 * The base is INJECTED (`resolveBaseRef`), not resolved here: it lives in
 * the task DB and the board/config defaults, and keeping those imports out
 * of this module is what lets its unit test run on a mocked git alone.
 *
 * Pure read-only. Never fetches; the counts are as current as the remote-
 * tracking refs, which the background fetch scheduler keeps refreshed for
 * the focused project. Uses `simple-git` (already a project dep, used by
 * `WorktreeManager` and `DiffService`). Each worktree spawns a couple of
 * git invocations; for a project with many worktrees the calls run in
 * parallel via `Promise.all`.
 *
 * Failure modes: if a project's path no longer exists on disk, that project
 * appears with an empty `worktrees` array. Individual worktrees that fail
 * to resolve (e.g. mid-rebase, broken HEAD) get a record with as much info
 * as we can salvage and `branch` / `dirty` set to `null` / `false`.
