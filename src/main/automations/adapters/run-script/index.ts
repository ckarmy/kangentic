/**
 * Run script. Three things changed from the action it replaces, and all three
 * were bugs rather than features.
 *
 * It AWAITS the process and records its exit code. The old `run_script` awaited
 * the spawn DISPATCH and nothing else, so a non-zero exit was undetectable. An
 * automation that says "run setup, then message the agent" has to mean it,
 * which is only true if the script finishes first.
 *
 * It is a CHILD PROCESS, not a PTY. The first attempt reused
 * `SessionManager.spawn`, which opens an interactive shell and TYPES the
 * command into it; the shell then returns to its prompt and lives forever, so
 * the script's completion is unobservable and its exit code unobtainable. That
 * shipped and was caught in a preview: a script that finished in under a second
 * was recorded as "Gave up after 60s". Nobody watches a script's terminal, so
 * the PTY bought nothing and cost exactly the thing the adapter exists to do.
 * `resolveScriptInvocation` gives the same shell its non-interactive form.
 *
 * And there is no working-directory setting any more. A script always runs
 * task-relative, in the task's worktree or the project checkout when it has
 * none, so the one thing a user needed the setting for is now the default and
 * the legacy `workingDir` key is ignored.
