/**
 * Run one column's automations for one trigger.
 *
 * This is where every reliability promise actually lives, and each one exists
 * because its absence was a live defect in the action system this replaces:
 *
 * - **Every row is isolated.** One throw used to abort the rest of the list
 *   (`transition-engine.ts`'s loop had no inner try), and the throw was then
 *   swallowed while the move still reported success. Now a failure is recorded
 *   and the next row runs. The rows are independent side effects; aborting
 *   means a webhook blip silently skips the agent message.
 * - **Every row is bounded.** Nothing timed out: `withTaskLock` is a PQueue
 *   with no timeout and the move's Phase 3 holds it across the whole list, so
 *   one hung webhook wedged every later operation on that task until a restart.
 * - **Every row is recorded.** There was no run table at all, so "did my
 *   automation run" had no answer.
 *
 * The runner never throws for an automation's sake. It rethrows exactly one
 * thing: an abort of the move itself, which is the caller's business.
