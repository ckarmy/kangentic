/**
 * The `tool` field a phone's `board-tool-read`/`board-tool-write` request
 * names is the INTERNAL command-registry key from
 * src/main/agent/commands/index.ts (`commandHandlers`, e.g. 'create_task',
 * 'update_task'), not a public MCP tool name. Despite the "tool"/"params"
 * shape, this is NOT the MCP protocol - no agent, LLM, or JSON-RPC
 * round-trip is involved anywhere in this path. It routes straight into
 * `commandHandlers`, reusing the exact same handlers + board-mutation
 * side-effect fan-out the actual MCP server also happens to dispatch into,
 * without re-deriving the `register*Tools` layer's zod schemas, defaulting,
 * rate limiting, or LLM-facing prose formatting - the same kind of direct
 * reuse read-board/move-task/etc. do against their own repositories/
 * handleTaskMove. This exists for the long tail of task/backlog CRUD
 * (create, edit, delete, link PR, ...) that does not warrant a bespoke
 * verb each.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded rather than reachable-by-omission:
 * - `move_task`, `reorder_tasks`, `list_tasks`, `list_columns`, `list_backlog` -
 *   NOT unsafe, but duplicates: the dedicated `move-task` and `read-board` verbs
 *   already cover moving a task and listing tasks/columns/backlog, with a
 *   cleaner contract (swimlaneId not column-name resolution; full Task/
 *   Swimlane objects, not LLM-prose-oriented summaries) and, for
 *   read-board, a live subscription these one-shot tools do not have.
 *   `move-task` carries a `targetPosition`, so within-column placement is
 *   already a phone capability through it; `reorder_tasks` would be a second
 *   contract for that same action, differing only in doing a whole column at
 *   once. If bulk re-sequencing from a phone is ever wanted, it belongs in
 *   `move-task`'s verb family with a real schema, not reached by omission here.
 *   Keeping them reachable through BOTH paths would mean two different
 *   contracts for the same action with no reason to prefer one - excluding
 *   them here keeps exactly one path per capability.
 * - `query_db` (raw SQL escape hatch - the research doc's explicit
 *   "minus code-execution verbs (no devtools/browser/raw-query_db)").
 * - `create_column` / `delete_column` - board STRUCTURE, not task CRUD, which is
 *   what this path exists for. Both are also the worst fit for a path that
 *   skips the `register*Tools` zod layer: `board-tool.ts` validates only that
 *   `params` is an object, so `delete_column`'s `params.column as string` and
 *   `create_column`'s 13 `String()`/`Number()`/`Boolean()` coercions would take
 *   arbitrary JSON with no narrowing. Reshaping a board from a phone is not a
 *   capability anyone has asked for; if it is ever wanted, give it a bespoke
 *   verb with its own schema rather than reaching it by omission here.
 * - Everything NOT in `commandHandlers` at all: the `kangentic_browser_*`
 *   family and the dev-only `kangentic_devtools_*` family are registered
 *   through entirely separate registries, never through `commandHandlers` -
 *   so building this allowlist FROM `commandHandlers`'s keys excludes them
 *   for free, with no separate name-matching needed. The same is true of
 *   the diagnostics tools (`tail_logs`, `get_recent_crashes`,
 *   `get_process_metrics`, `get_ipc_log`, `list_worktrees`) and the
 *   remaining cross-project tools (`list_projects`, unified `search`,
 *   `move_task_to_project`) - none of them are `commandHandlers` entries,
 *   so none of them are reachable here.
