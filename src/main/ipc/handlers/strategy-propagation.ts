/**
 * Push a settings change into tasks' LIVE sessions.
 *
 * Two edits can change what a running session should be using: editing a column
 * (`SWIMLANE_UPDATE`) and editing a Board Profile (`BOARD_CONFIG_SET_BOARD_PROFILES`).
 * They used to be one hand-written block in the swimlane handler, which meant a
 * profile edit reached in-flight sessions not at all - a task riding an edited
 * profile kept its old model until the user moved it out and back. Routing both
 * through here is the same reasoning as `spawn-entry-point-parity`: behavior that
 * must apply however the change was made belongs at one chokepoint.
 *
 * Suspended and queued sessions need no help - `prepare-spawn` re-reads the
 * effective strategy when they resume.
 *
 * THE GATE IS PER TASK, comparing the task's own resolved before/after rather
 * than the raw column's. That is what makes the column path correct for a
 * profiled task: editing a column's model must NOT push that model into a task
 * whose profile pins a different one for that column, and before this was
 * extracted the swimlane handler passed the raw lane and did exactly that.
 *
 * A MODEL change restarts the session (suspend + `--resume --model`) rather than
 * live-injecting `/model`, matching the column-transition and ContextBar paths.
 * An EFFORT change still swaps live.
 *
 * An `auto_spawn` change is reconciled here too, via `reconcileAutoSpawnChange`.
 * That one cannot ride the loop below: the loop bails on `!task.session_id`, so
 * it can only ever inject into or restart an EXISTING session, never create one.
 *
 * `projectId` is a required parameter rather than a read of
 * `context.currentProjectId` because the reconcile spawns and suspends. A
 * mis-targeted keystroke injection is cosmetic; a mis-targeted spawn is not.
 * Required, not optional, so a future caller cannot silently fall back to
 * ambient state.
