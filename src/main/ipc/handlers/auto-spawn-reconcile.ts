/**
 * Apply an `auto_spawn` change to the tasks ALREADY living in the edited column.

 * Before this existed, `auto_spawn` was reconciled only by `autoSpawnTasks` on
 * project open, so switching a column on did nothing until the app restarted,
 * and switching it off left live sessions running in a column that no longer
 * wanted them. `propagateStrategyToLiveSessions` could not carry it: its gate is
 * blind to `auto_spawn`, and it bails on `!task.session_id`, so it is
 * structurally an inject-or-restart path that can never CREATE a session.
 *
 * Called from `propagateStrategyToLiveSessions`, so every surface that reaches
 * that chokepoint (a column edit, a Board Profile edit, the MCP `update_column`
 * tool) reconciles identically. That is the same parity argument the chokepoint
 * itself was extracted for.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP: the `kangentic.json` file watcher (`BOARD_CONFIG_APPLY` ->
 * `apply-config.ts`) also writes `auto_spawn` and does not route through here, so
 * a `git pull` that flips `autoSpawn` still needs a restart. Deliberate: that
 * path fires for whichever project changed on disk, often not the focused one,
 * which makes spawning agents from it materially riskier than from a deliberate
 * user edit.
 *
 * `projectId` is explicit and never resolved from ambient context: a
 * mis-targeted keystroke injection is cosmetic, a mis-targeted SPAWN is not.
