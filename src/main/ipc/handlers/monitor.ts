/**
 * Agent Monitor IPC. Machine-global: nothing here takes a projectId, because the
 * snapshot deliberately spans every registered project.
 *
 * Freshness contract (see monitor-aggregator.ts for why this is cheap):
 *   - Live activity does NOT come through this handler. `SESSION_ACTIVITY` is
 *     already broadcast unbuffered with its projectId, and the renderer patches it
 *     onto the matching row in place. That is the common case and costs nothing.
 *   - This handler only re-pushes when the DB-resident half of a row can have
 *     changed: a session appeared / changed status / exited, or an AGENT edited a
 *     board (the BoardEventBus is agent-driven only). A USER edit can only ever
 *     target the project whose board is open, so the renderer covers that case
 *     itself rather than us broadcasting on every local keystroke.
 *   - There is no timer. Elapsed time ticks client-side.
