 * field on success; a non-null value here therefore means the original
 * cleanup failed - typically because orphaned subprocesses spawned by the
 * killed Claude CLI were still holding file handles on the worktree.
 *
 * By the time the user relaunches Kangentic, those orphaned processes are
 * gone, so this pass usually succeeds on the first try. The retry reuses the
 * full `WorktreeManager.removeWorktree` flow (node_modules cleanup -> git
 * worktree remove --force -> removeWithRetry fallback) so it handles every
 * removal mode the original move attempted. On success we clear
 * `worktree_path`, which also unsticks the task for resume if the user later
 * drags it out of Done (`ensureWorktree` skips only when `worktree_path` still
 * points at a live worktree on disk; a cleared or husk path recreates it).
 *
 * Runs on every project open and on app-startup activate-all, piggybacking
 * on `cleanupStaleResourcesAsync`. The branch is preserved - only the
 * worktree directory goes away.
 *
 * Wraps each task's cleanup in `withTaskLock` so a concurrent TASK_MOVE on
 * the same task (user drags it out of Done right as we start retrying)
 * cannot race with the removal + DB clear.
