// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Spawn progress: typed phases emitted to the renderer during task move
//
// Mirrors session-lifecycle.ts pattern: typed phases, centralized labels.
// The main process emits progress at phase boundaries; the renderer stores
// the latest label per task and displays it.
//
// Phase flow (contextual per task):
//   Worktree task:      fetching → creating-worktree → [init-script] → starting-agent
//   Custom branch task: fetching → switching-branch  → starting-agent
//   Base branch task:   fetching → switching-branch  → starting-agent
//   Has worktree:       starting-agent (a base-drift probe may decorate it, see below)
//   Cross-agent:        switching-agent → starting-agent → packaging-handoff → detecting-agent
//   Restore from Done:  resuming → (whichever of the above the task needs)
//   Model change:       switching-model → (whichever of the above the task needs)
//   Effort respawn:     applying-settings → (whichever of the above the task needs)
//   Session switch:     new-session → (whichever of the above the task needs)
//   In-place restart:   switching-model | applying-settings | resending-command
//                       (restartSessionForSettingsChange: no git work follows)
//
// 'resuming' is emitted by TASK_UNARCHIVE / TASK_BULK_UNARCHIVE before any git
// work, so the card is never silent while the lane resolves and the git op
// queues. 'switching-model', 'switching-agent', 'applying-settings', and
// 'new-session' are emitted the same way by task-move.ts's Phase 1
// suspend-for-respawn branches, before the suspend that would otherwise leave
// the card reading a stale "Paused" for the whole unlocked Phase 2 window (see
// suspendLiveSessionForRespawn). The in-place restart in session-reconcile.ts
// (a ContextBar model pick, a Board Profile propagation, or the auto_command
// escalation) emits its phase before its suspend for the same reason, and
// because the mobile bridge attaches whatever label is in flight to the
// suspend's `session-ended` so the phone can tell a respawn from a park.
// Every other phase is emitted by the git helpers themselves.
//
// QUERYABLE STATE (not just fire-once IPC): the latest in-flight label per
// task is also retained in a module-level map so the renderer can re-derive
// it at any time via getInFlightSpawnProgress() / IPC.TASK_GET_SPAWN_PROGRESS.
// This closes the HMR-strand bug where the clearing push fired in the
// IPC-listener-reattach gap and left a task stuck on "Starting agent...":
// syncSessions() now reconciles spawnProgress against this map instead of
// relying on having had a listener attached at emit time. The main process is
// a single esbuild bundle with no HMR, so this module-level state is a safe
// singleton.
