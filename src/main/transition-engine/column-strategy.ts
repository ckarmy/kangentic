/**
 * Board Profiles: turning (column, profile) into the strategy a spawn runs under.
 *
 * A Board Profile is a named alternate ladder of per-column STRATEGY settings,
 * so one task can run Planning in Opus xhigh, Executing in Opus high, and Merge
 * in Sonnet high while another rides a cheaper ladder over the same board.
 * Column identity (which columns exist, their name, order, role, color, icon) is
 * singular across profiles; only strategy is profile-scoped.
 *
 * This module is the ONE place a profile is folded into a column's settings.
 * Every spawn-affecting read of a lane's strategy fields goes through it, so a
 * profile can never be honored on one code path and silently ignored on another
 * (the failure mode `auto_command` already shipped: honored on a cold spawn,
 * dropped on a warm move). `tests/unit/column-strategy-parity.test.ts` enforces
 * that mechanically.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and TOTAL - no throws, no I/O. It runs inside
 * `runSpawnPreamble` on both spawn chokepoints, and profiles live in a
 * checked-in config file while task assignments live in the local DB, so a
 * teammate deleting a profile must degrade to the base column rather than wedge
 * an in-flight task.
