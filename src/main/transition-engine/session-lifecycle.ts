// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Session lifecycle: centralized state machine for session DB records
//
// All DB status transitions flow through these functions. They use atomic
// compare-and-set SQL (compareAndUpdateStatus) to prevent race conditions
// between concurrent writers (e.g. suspend() vs onExit handler).
//
// Valid transitions:
//   queued     → running    (slot opened)
//   queued     → exited     (cancelled before start)
//   running    → suspended  (user pause, move to Done, auto_spawn=false, or a
//                            PTY exit during app shutdown via onExit hardening)
//   running    → exited     (Claude exits naturally, crash, killed)
//   suspended  → exited     (replaced by new session on resume)
//   orphaned   → exited     (recovery dedup, or failed recovery)
//   orphaned   → suspended  (pause-on-restart setting upgrades crashed sessions)
//   exited     → suspended  (preserve for future resume on move to Done; also
//                            startup recovery upgrading an OS-killed
//                            interrupted-exited record)

 * 2. Stale recovery: agent_session_id was pre-specified (Claude) but the

 * 3. Mid-session fork: the agent moved the live conversation to a NEW id
