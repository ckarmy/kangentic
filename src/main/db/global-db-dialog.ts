/**
 * The user-facing policy for an unreadable global database.
 *
 * Sentry DESKTOP-9/A/B: one install hit `SQLITE_IOERR` on `index.db` at launch.
 * `SQLITE_IOERR` is environmental - an antivirus scan, a OneDrive or Dropbox
 * sync lock, or failing storage - so there is nothing to fix in the query. What
 * was worth fixing is that the app said nothing: the raw `SqliteError` crossed
 * IPC as `Error invoking remote method 'project:list'` and startup carried on
 * into a half-initialized state. Low frequency, wide blast radius. This is the
 * failure mode where the app looks broken with no explanation.
 *
 * One dialog, two entry points, so the copy cannot drift:
 *
 *   - `ensureGlobalDbReadable()` at startup, before any window exists.
 *   - `notifyGlobalDbUnavailable()` for a read that degraded mid-session.
 *
 * Always the async `dialog.showMessageBox`, never `showMessageBoxSync`: a sync
 * dialog blocks the main process, which would freeze every live PTY.

 * proven readable before any window exists, which is the ordering that stops

 * clicked after recovery used to reject with no explanation. That limit is
