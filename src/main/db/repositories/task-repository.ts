 * Enforce profile-vs-pin mutual exclusivity and keep `run_mode` consistent with

 *
 * This is the single write-time chokepoint for the invariant, so IPC, MCP, the
 * mobile bridge, and every other caller inherit it rather than each remembering
 * the rule. It is load-bearing beyond tidiness:
 * `lockAdvancedOverridesOnFirstSpawn` fires on `run_mode === 'agent_override'`,
 * so a profile task that also claimed override mode would get all four fields
 * frozen to its first column's values and its ladder would silently flatten.
 *
 * `requested` must contain only the fields the caller explicitly provided
 * (`undefined` = untouched). Reading intent from `requested` rather than from the
 * merged `next` is what makes "pin a model on a task that currently rides a
 * profile" do the obvious thing - switch it to Custom - instead of the merged
 * view seeing a non-null profile_id and throwing the new pin away.
 *
 * Precedence, highest first:
 *   1. A profile assignment wins outright: it is the more specific intent, and
 *      it is how the UI expresses "switch this task off its Custom pins onto a
 *      ladder". It clears the pins AND forces `'column_settings'`.
 *   2. Pinning any of the four, or asking for `'agent_override'` explicitly,
 *      means override mode and detaches from the profile. The explicit mode
 *      matters on its own: "Agent Override with everything left on inherit"
 *      pins nothing, and is exactly the state the derived-mode approach lost.
 *   3. Asking for `'column_settings'` clears the pins, mirroring what the
 *      dialog's Column Settings card does locally.
 * A write touching none of them leaves all three alone.

  /**
   * Rewrite a column's task order as dense positions (0..n-1) in one
   * transaction. This is the write behind the MCP placement surface:
   * `kangentic_reorder_tasks`, and `kangentic_move_task`'s same-column
   * `position`.
   *
   * A dense rewrite rather than a sequence of `move()` calls, for three
   * reasons. It is atomic. It is immune to the ordinal-vs-raw hazard `move()`
   * inherits from gapped positions (`archive()` leaves `position` untouched and
   * `create` takes `MAX(position) + 1` over archived rows, so a column's live
   * cards can sit at 0, 5, 9). And it HEALS those gaps, in any column where
   * every id passed is a member of that column - which is what both callers
   * guarantee. A stray id consumes its slot as a no-op (the `swimlane_id`
   * guard), so a caller that skipped that check would leave the column gapped
   * rather than dense.
   *
   * It writes `position` and NOTHING ELSE - deliberately, and this is
   * load-bearing rather than an omission. `move()` bumps `updated_at` only on
   * the row that actually moved; its two position-shift UPDATEs leave siblings
   * alone. `lane-pins.ts` builds on exactly that: a lane pin holds while the
   * server keeps telling the pre-move story, and it drops the moment a payload
   * differs in {presence, lane, `updated_at`}, so a sibling merely shifting
   * position must not carry a fresh stamp or it spuriously drops a pin and the
   * user's in-flight card snaps back mid-drag. Stamping every reordered row
   * would break that. The board still repaints, because
   * `structural-sharing.ts` compares `position` field-by-field rather than
   * keying off `updated_at`. The `position != ?` guard keeps re-issuing the
   * same order a no-write, and the `swimlane_id` guard makes an id from another
   * column a no-op rather than a cross-column corruption.
   *
   * Deliberately NOT wrapped in `withTaskLock`
   * (`.claude/rules/task-lifecycle-lock.md`, which is path-scoped to
   * `src/main/ipc/**` and so does not auto-load at the call sites): that lock is
   * per-task and documented non-reentrant, so there is no correct way to hold it
   * for the N tasks a reorder mutates. The rule's own carve-out covers this
   * instead - the whole rewrite is synchronous, so it cannot interleave with
   * anything and there is no race to serialize. Two accepted residuals, both
   * presentation-only and both self-healing on the next drag or reorder:
   * `handleTaskMove` captures a task's `originalPosition` before its unlocked
   * git I/O and restores it on rollback, so a reorder landing inside that window
   * makes the rollback restore a stale position; and `handleMoveTask`'s
   * CROSS-column path resolves an ordinal to a raw anchor synchronously but
   * hands it to a fire-and-forget `onTaskMove`, so a reorder of the destination
   * lane before that write lands leaves the incoming card beside a different
   * neighbour than the one the anchor named.
