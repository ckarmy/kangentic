/**
 * Keeps the agent message trail every board card shows: the newest few things
 * each session's agent said, computed in main and PUSHED on change, so a card
 * never fetches a transcript. `resolveTaskTranscript` stitches every session a
 * task ever had (267MB for one task, 319MB across 20 files for a single mobile
 * home-feed refresh, per its own comment), and a board renders every visible
 * card at once, so a per-card read is the one way this feature ships broken.
 *
 * Trigger: the hook events every running session already emits, for every
 * agent (`SessionManager`'s `'event'`), plus `'session-changed'` so a spawn or
 * resume seeds the trail and an exit takes a final read. Each trigger is
 * coalesced per session: one immediate read, then one trailing read after
 * `MESSAGE_TRAIL_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, and a burst inside that interval folds into
 * the same trailing timer. The trailing read is what makes the trigger set
 * safe: a hook fires as the agent finishes a step, and the record it announces
 * can still be landing on disk.
 *
 * Read: the adapter's stateless bounded window (`parseTranscriptWindow`) over
 * only the bytes appended since the last read. The first read stats the file
 * and starts `MESSAGE_TRAIL_TAIL_BYTES` from its end, so a resumed session
 * shows what its previous run said at once; later reads start at the cursor
 * the previous window handed back. Nothing is retained between reads but that
 * cursor and the trail. An adapter without the window capability falls back
 * to the stat-validated cached parse (`getCachedTranscript`), rate-limited
 * harder because a changed file re-parses its whole bounded tail there.
 *
 * Retention: a trail outlives its session until the session leaves the registry
 * or the map hits `MESSAGE_TRAIL_MAX_SESSIONS`.
 *
 * That retention no longer has a consumer, and the reason is worth writing down
 * rather than quietly deleting. It existed so a paused or exited card could keep
 * showing what its agent last said. Every card now hides the trail the moment the
 * session stops running and falls back to the task description, because a trail
 * under a paused glyph, with no progress bar, was indistinguishable from prose
 * the user wrote themselves (`CardMessageTrail`, `monitorSlotKind`). So the
 * retention past exit, and the final read `'session-changed'` takes on the way
 * out, are both dead value today: bounded and harmless (200 sessions x 5 lines),
 * but not load-bearing. Left in place because it is the cheap direction to be
 * wrong in - a trail that outlives its session costs one idle map entry, while
 * dropping it eagerly would need a new signal at exit and would foreclose ever
 * showing a finished agent's last words again.
 *
 * A registry removal drops the state eagerly, on `'session-removed'`. The cap
 * prune and the `snapshot()` diff against the registry stay as the backstop for
 * anything that leaves the registry some other way.
 *
 * Unlike `MonitorPeekTracker`, this tracker is not subscribe-gated. The peek
 * tracker taps live PTY output, so it stays off until a monitor names the
 * sessions it draws; this one reads a bounded file tail on a hook the agent
 * already fired, and the board is mounted whenever the app is, so there is no
 * "nobody is looking" state to gate on.
