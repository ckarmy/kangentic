/**
 * Pre-populate Qwen Code's trusted-folders entry for a worktree path so
 * the trust prompt is skipped when spawning an agent.
 *
 * Qwen Code (inheriting from upstream Gemini CLI) stores per-folder trust
 * decisions in ~/.qwen/trustedFolders.json as a flat object mapping
 * absolute forward-slashed paths to one of three trust-level strings:
 * "TRUST_FOLDER", "TRUST_PARENT", or "DO_NOT_TRUST". We only ever write
 * "TRUST_FOLDER" ourselves; the other two are user-managed values we
 * detect and leave alone (no downgrade, no override of an explicit deny).
 *
 * The feature is gated on the security.folderTrust.enabled flag in
 * ~/.qwen/settings.json. When disabled (the upstream default), Qwen
 * implicitly trusts every folder and writing trustedFolders.json would
 * be needless clutter in the user's home directory - so we skip.
