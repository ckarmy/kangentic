/**
 * Qwen's `command-injection` verifier. CONFIRM-ONLY.
 *
 * Confirm-only despite a clean measurement, because the path below is built
 * from a CAPTURED session id and this resolver has never run against a live
 * Qwen session inside the app. See
 * `QwenAdapter.canEscalateOnVerificationFailure`.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs, 2026-08-08),
 * scoped to `chats/<sessionId>.jsonl` - the file this verifier actually reads:
 *   short prompt: 443ms, 519ms   (turn ~3.0s)
 *   long prompt:  696ms          (turn ~13.5s)
 * Flat against a turn 4.5x longer, so the write happens on submit.
 *
 * MEASURE THE FILE THE VERIFIER READS. An unscoped first run reported 124-201ms
 * because the probe text lands in `~/.qwen/tmp/<hash>/logs.json` (a prompt log)
 * long before the chats JSONL. Crediting the verifier with that number would
 * have understated its real latency by ~3.5x. The numbers above are from a
 * scan restricted to the chats file.
 *
 * Qwen is slower than Codex and lands ABOVE the 400ms single-attempt window, so
 * confirmation typically arrives on the second Enter attempt rather than the
 * first. That is well within the ~4s budget (5 attempts plus the grace) and is why the retry
 * loop exists; it is recorded here so a future tightening of
 * `VERIFY_WINDOW_MS` is understood to put Qwen at risk first.

/**
 * Resolve the chats JSONL for a session.
 *
 * Pure path construction - Qwen names the file exactly `<sessionId>.jsonl`
 * because the adapter passes `--session-id <uuid>`, so unlike Codex there is
 * no directory scan and nothing to memoise. Existence is deliberately NOT
 * checked here: the shared tail reader returns null for a missing file, which
 * the caller treats as "keep polling", and skipping the extra `existsSync`
 * saves a syscall on every 25ms poll.

 *    "type":"user","provenance":"real_user","cwd":"...","version":"0.21.7",
 *    "message":{"role":"user","parts":[{"text":"..."}]}}
 *
 * `provenance` separates genuine input from replayed or synthetic turns, so
 * anything that is present and not `real_user` is skipped. Older Qwen builds
 * omit the field entirely; those records are still accepted, since the exact
 * text match is what actually decides the answer.
