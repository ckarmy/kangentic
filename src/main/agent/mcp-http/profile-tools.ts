 * Register the Board Profile tools.
 *
 * A Board Profile is a named alternate ladder of per-column strategy settings,
 * so one task can run Planning in Opus xhigh and Merge in Sonnet high while
 * another rides a cheaper ladder over the same board. A task selects one via
 * `profile` on kangentic_create_task / kangentic_update_task.
 *
 * These tools exist mainly to keep profiles in sync as models and strategies
 * change, which is tedious by hand and spans projects: "change Opus 4.8 to Opus
 * 5 everywhere", "copy this board's Heavy profile into project X", "what differs
 * between project A's and B's profiles". Every tool takes `project`, so a diff
 * or a copy is two calls against different boards.
 *
 * Profiles are addressed by NAME (or id) and their entries are keyed by COLUMN
 * NAME, never by uuid - names are what an agent can read from a listing, and
 * they are the only key that means anything when copying between projects.
