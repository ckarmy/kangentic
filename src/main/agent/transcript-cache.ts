 * The entry cap used to be 16, which is smaller than a single working set: a
 * `--resume` writes a NEW transcript file replaying its parent's whole
 * history, so one task resumed five times owns five files, and a live board
 * measured 20 files (319MB) behind ONE mobile Home-feed refresh. At 16 the
 * LRU evicted faster than the feed could reuse it, so every refresh re-parsed
 * from scratch - the cache was doing strictly negative work.
 *
 * Raised well past a realistic board, and bounded by BYTES as well so the
 * larger count cannot turn into unbounded memory: parsed entries are roughly
 * proportional to their source file, and a handful of 50MB transcripts would
 * otherwise dwarf everything else. Whichever bound binds first evicts.
 *
 * THE BYTE BUDGET COUNTS SOURCE BYTES, NOT RETAINED HEAP. `record.size` is the
 * transcript's size on disk, which is a CONSERVATIVE proxy: measured on a real
 * 137.9MB transcript, a whole-file parse retained 12.7MB of entries (0.09x
 * source), and these records are truncated on top of that. So the nominal 192MB
 * corresponds to well under 192MB of heap in practice. The one place the proxy
 * understates cost is tool-heavy transcripts, because `truncateEntries` passes
 * `tool_use` blocks through by reference with their `input` deliberately
 * unclamped.
 *
 * Kept at 192MB rather than lowered: the working set this exists to hold was
 * measured at 20 files / 319MB behind a single mobile Home-feed refresh, and
 * cutting under that reintroduces the thrash described above. The per-parse cap
 * (`MAX_PARSE_SOURCE_BYTES`) is what keeps any SINGLE record small.
