 * between sessions. This is unconditional, not a user setting - "the
 * conversation for this task" always means its full history end to end,
 * regardless of what changed mid-task (model, agent, isolation).
 *
 * `anchorSessionId` resolves only WHICH task to show; the returned entries
 * span every session sharing that task_id, oldest first, each assistant entry
 * stamped with the agentName of the session it came from (the response's own
 * top-level agentName only describes the latest one). A session with no
 * task_id (a rare orphan/transient record) has nothing to unify across, so it
 * degrades to just its own entries. Returns null only when the anchor session
 * id resolves to no record at all.

 * DEDUP: a `--resume` session's native transcript REPLAYS its parent session's
 * full history (identical messages, identical per-message uuids), so naively
 * concatenating every session double-counts every shared turn. We deduplicate
 * by uuid keeping the FIRST occurrence. Unique uuids are also what the viewer
 * keys its rows and its virtualizer measurement cache on, so a duplicate would
 * otherwise break React reconciliation and stack rows on top of each other.
 *
 * CHRONOLOGY: a session's turns are NOT contiguous in time. A main session is
 * suspended for an isolated-swimlane excursion and then RESUMED into the same
 * transcript, so its post-excursion turns are timestamped AFTER the isolated
 * session's turns. Grouping the timeline by session would bury those newest
 * turns in the middle (and make live growth look frozen). So we merge every
 * deduped turn by its own `ts` and insert a `session_boundary` divider wherever
 * consecutive turns cross a session - including the return to a session seen
 * earlier, not just the switch into an isolated one. The divider reads simply
 * "New session" the first time a session appears and "Resumed session" when the
 * timeline crosses back into one it already showed. The initial run of turns has
 * no leading divider.
