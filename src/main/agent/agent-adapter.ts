   *      one that catches a broken path derivation or a session id that never
   *      got captured. Both produce a permanent false negative, and a permanent
   *      false negative escalates every auto_command the adapter ever receives.
   *
   * The harness satisfies (1) only. It hunts a nonce with its own file reader,

   * points at that file or whether the CLI wrapped the stored text (Cursor
   * stores `<user_query>...</user_query>`, which would never trim-equal the
   * submitted text). `docs/command-injection.md` has the mock-CLI recipe for
   * (2); it costs no agent quota.

   *     project, so neither the id nor `cwd` helps locate it.
