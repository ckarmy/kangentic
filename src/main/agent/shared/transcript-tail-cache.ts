 * import it directly, Codex / Qwen / Kimi reach it through
 * `submitted-text-verifier.ts`. Copilot (a global JSON blob it must re-read
 * whole) and OpenCode (a SQL query) have nothing to tail and bypass it.
 *
 * This is generic file reading, not per-agent parsing: `agent-adapters-boundary`
 * constrains where agent-specific RECORD SHAPES live, and those stay in each
 * adapter's folder. Copying this machinery per adapter is the failure mode it
 * exists to prevent - the cache is only correct while it is module-global and
 * shared (see below).

/**

 *

 * needs entries written in the last few hundred milliseconds. Reading the whole
 * file to look at its tail is what made verification expensive: a long session's
 * JSONL is multiple megabytes, and `pollForConfirmation` asks every 25ms.

/**
 * Parsed tail, keyed by path and invalidated by (size, mtime).
 *
 * Verification polls at 25ms for up to ~4s per command, but the agent writes to
 * the transcript far less often than that, so the overwhelming majority of
 * polls would re-read and re-split bytes that have not changed. A `stat` costs
 * microseconds against a read plus a `split()` over tens of thousands of lines.
 *
 * Cached by CONTENT IDENTITY rather than by query result, which keeps it safe
 * for any (command, sentAt) pair: identical bytes always parse to identical
 * lines, so a later poll for a different command reuses the array without
 * inheriting an answer. That property is also what lets adapters share one
 * cache: a Codex rollout and a Claude transcript are distinct keys, and neither
 * can answer the other's query.
 *
 * This matters most in bursts. Injection concurrency is per task, so dragging
 * several tasks into a column at once starts several poll loops, each of which
 * was independently re-reading a multi-megabyte file 40 times a second in the
 * MAIN process, where the cost lands on IPC and therefore on the UI.
 *
 * MODULE-GLOBAL ON PURPOSE. It cannot be scoped to a verifier closure:
 * `getSubmissionVerifier` builds a fresh verifier once per POLL (the transcript
 * path is derived from a session id that is re-resolved each time, to survive a
 * mid-burst `/clear` fork), so a closure-local cache would be rebuilt 40 times a
 * second and never hit.
 *
 * EVICTION IS LRU, NOT CLEAR-ALL, and that distinction is the whole point in
 * the case this exists for. A clear-all on overflow degenerates precisely
 * under burst: with more concurrent transcripts than slots, each insert wipes
 * every other burst's entry, they all miss on their next poll, re-read, and
 * evict each other again - turning the cache into pure overhead at exactly
 * the concurrency where it is needed. Least-recently-used eviction keeps every
 * actively-polling burst resident and ages out only finished ones.

 * The cap is sized against CONCURRENT TRANSCRIPTS, not tasks: the `/clear`-fork
 * fallback in `buildCommandInjectionVerifier` scans two paths per poll (the
 * re-resolved id, then the one captured at plan-build time), so a forked
 * session occupies two slots. Now that every adapter shares this cache, a mixed
 * board can hold entries for several agents at once, which is a further reason
 * the bound is generous. 32 leaves room for well past any realistic
 * simultaneous drag. Entries self-invalidate on `(size, mtime)`, so the only
