 *
 * It used to loop the vars and re-scan its OWN accumulated output, and because
 * `resolveTaskTemplateVars` inserts in catalog order, `task_xml` substituted
 * before `title`. So a task DESCRIPTION containing the literal text
 * `{{title}}` was substituted a second time, on the script and webhook paths.
 * A single pass cannot re-scan what it just wrote.
 *
 * It also built `new RegExp(key)` with the key unescaped, which was latent only
 * because every name happened to be `[A-Za-z_]+`. The shared pattern matches
 * `\w+` and the key is a plain object lookup, so a name can never be read as a
 * regex again.

/**
 * Task-template interpolation for auto_command and spawn_agent promptTemplate
 * only (not the general interpolateTemplate consumers like send_command/
 * run_script/webhook). Differs from interpolateTemplate in two ways:
 *
 *   1. An empty-valued OR unknown `{{key}}` is dropped instead of left as a
 *      literal placeholder or a dangling empty string.
 *   2. Horizontal whitespace in the template's LITERAL TEXT collapses to a
 *      single space. That covers the run left behind by a dropped placeholder,
 *      so `/code-review {{baseBranch}}` with an empty baseBranch yields
 *      `/code-review`, not `/code-review ` with a trailing space. Note the
 *      collapse is not limited to drop sites: it normalizes ALL literal
 *      spacing in the template, so a hand-aligned `/foo  --flag` (double
 *      space) delivers as `/foo --flag`. Substituted values are exempt.
 *
 * Resolves and strips against the TEMPLATE, never the interpolated output: a
 * substituted value (e.g. a task description that itself contains the text
 * "{{title}}") is inserted verbatim and never re-scanned for placeholders, so
 * legitimate content in a resolved value cannot be corrupted by this pass.
 *
 * Newlines are preserved - only runs of spaces/tabs collapse, and only within
 * template text (never inside a substituted value). This keeps a multi-line
 * {{task_xml}} envelope intact, down to a markdown hard break inside the raw
 * description, while still cleaning up a single-line auto_command whose
 * trailing keyword resolved empty. The leading/trailing edges of the whole
 * result are trimmed only when that edge is template text; an outermost
 * substituted value keeps its own surrounding whitespace.
