/**
 * Shared `command-injection` verifier for adapters whose session history
 * records a user turn as its own record.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ANSWERS
 * "Did exactly this text become a user turn after `sentAt`?" That is the
 * `submitted` verify mode, and it is the mode that matters: `prepareInjectionPlan`
 * tags the user's `auto_command` as `submitted`, and `TerminalSubmitScheduler`
 * only ever escalates a failed `submitted` command.
 *
 * WHY THE MATCH IS EXACT
 * The bug this exists to catch is a swallowed Enter, where the next keystrokes
 * concatenate into the same prompt buffer. The reported case submits
 * `instead can we/pull-request`, which CONTAINS `/pull-request`, so a substring
 * test would confirm precisely the failure the verifier is for. Comparison is
 * therefore trim-equality on the whole user turn, never `includes`.
 *
 * That same exactness makes one implementation serve `command-match` too: a
 * combined submission records as `"/model X\n/effort Y"`, which does not
 * trim-equal `"/model X"`, so it reads as a miss and the burst retries - the
 * same recovery Claude's tag-shaped matcher provides.
 *
 * SAFETY CONTRACT (read before adding an adapter)
 * A verifier is what AUTHORIZES a restart: a `failed` outcome escalates to a
 * session respawn that destroys live work. So a verifier must only ever be
 * wired for an agent whose history is measured to flush on SUBMIT, not on
 * turn-end (`scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs`). Returning `false` here
 * means "not yet seen", and the caller keeps polling within its window; an
 * unreadable or missing file must therefore also return `false` rather than
 * asserting a failure, because a missing file is the normal state for the
 * first few hundred milliseconds after a spawn.

 * (Kimi's wire format uses unix seconds, OpenCode uses epoch ms integers), so
 * the shared scan never needs to know which agent it is reading. Return `null`
 * when the timestamp is absent; the scan then accepts the record on text alone
 * rather than discarding it.
