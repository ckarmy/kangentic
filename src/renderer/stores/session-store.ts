 * intentionally dropped - the main process has removed that session
 * (suspend, respawn, full removal) and the renderer entry is stale.

 * For ids present in both maps, the store entry wins. An IPC push
 * (`onActivity`, `onUsage`, `onEvent`) may have delivered a fresher
 * value during the async gap between fetching the cache and applying
 * it; we don't want syncSessions to clobber that.
 *
 * Why not the simpler `{ ...cached, ...current }`: that variant
 * preserves entries that no longer exist in `cached`, leading to
 * indefinite leaks of `sessionActivity[id] = 'thinking'` (and
 * matching usage/events) for sessions the engine has already
 * dropped. HMR re-runs syncSessions on every renderer reload, so

 * coupled and hard to split cleanly.
 *
 * HMR, in two layers. The PRIMARY one is the Pattern E instance pin at the
 * bottom of this file: the whole store survives a re-eval, so none of the state
 * below resets. That is load-bearing beyond convenience. A slice edit used to
 * hand the mounted tree a second, empty store, and `browserOpenTasks` /
 * `browserHeldTasks` reading empty unmounted every live Browser pane - an
 * Electron `<webview>` guest dies with its DOM node, so the agent lost the
 * browser it was driving. Measured with `scripts/hmr-guest-probe.mjs`.
 *
 * The FALLBACK layer is the `import.meta.hot.dispose` stash above. Under the pin
 * its one LIVE consumer is `syncController` (an AbortController): that is module
 * state, not store state, so it is re-declared on every module evaluation and
 * read back at eval time - the stash is its only carrier, on every path. Without
 * it a re-eval breaks an in-flight project switch.
 *
 * The stash's other values (the transient-session pointers, spawnProgress,
 * pendingCommandLabel, the conversation-viewer nav signals) are read back only
 * INSIDE the initializer, and the pin means the initializer no longer re-runs
 * while `hot.data` survives: `hot.data.sessionStore` is written during the same
 * evaluation that runs the initializer, so any path that runs it again is one
 * where `hot.data` is itself fresh and the stash is empty too. They are the
 * pre-pin protection, kept rather than ripped out in the same change that
 * introduced the pin, but nothing reads them now - do not add a new value here
 * expecting it to survive a re-eval. Pin it instead.
 *
 * HMR re-sync: the `vite:afterUpdate` handler in App.tsx calls
 * `syncSessions()` after hot reload. Renaming syncSessions would
 * require updating that handler + the hmr-resync.test.ts unit test.
