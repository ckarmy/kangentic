/**
 * Done-drop confirmation payload. Two shapes:

 *   - `direct`: fallback when the drag origin rect was lost mid-drag
 *     (HMR / DOM destruction). Skips the animation but still routes
 *     through the confirm dialog so the destructive worktree delete
 *     isn't silent.
 * `task` is kept on both shapes so the dialog can show the task title.
 * `uncommittedFileCount` / `unpushedCommitCount` come from a pre-drop
 * `checkPendingChanges` probe and drive the dialog copy. `hasPendingChanges`
 * is stored separately rather than recomputed from the counts, so the
 * git-failure fallback path (which knows the worktree is suspect but has no
 * counts to report) can still lock the dialog into its danger styling.
 * `currentBranch` is the worktree's live HEAD branch (null on detached HEAD or
 * probe failure); the dialog prefers it over the stored slug, which agents
 * rename inside the worktree. `autoCleanup` is captured at drop time so the
 * dialog can state the branch's real fate: kept (recreatable) when off,
 * force-deleted when on.
