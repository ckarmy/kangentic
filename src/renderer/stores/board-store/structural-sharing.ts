 * query result; see
 * https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/render-optimizations

 * version sufficient for our row shapes; full recursive structural sharing
 * would handle nested objects as well, which our rows don't need.
 *
 * Returns a NEW top-level array (callers rely on a fresh outer ref to
 * retrigger downstream memos). Individual elements are reused when equal.

/**
 * Field-by-field equality for Task. Faster than JSON.stringify and avoids

 *
 * EXHAUSTIVE over the `Task` interface, deliberately. It used to compare a
 * subset and lean on `updated_at` to catch the rest, which held only because
 * the generic `update()` always bumps it - so the fields written by the bespoke
 * no-bump setters (`setDetailViewState`, `recordAutoCommandOutcome`) could
 * change with the stale reference reused. Comparing everything removes that
 * reasoning step entirely; the cost is a few more primitive compares per task.
 *
 * When a new field is added to the `Task` interface in `src/shared/types.ts`,
 * add it here too. `tests/unit/structural-sharing.test.ts` derives the expected
 * field list FROM that interface and fails naming the missing field.
