/**
 * Per-project state cache for warm project switches.
 *
 * Today every `currentProject` change in App.tsx fires a coordinated
 * 5-IPC fan-out (board, backlog, config, sessions x 2) and hard-resets
 * per-project UI state. This cache makes a round-trip (A -> B -> A
 * within the same process lifetime) a pointer swap: zero IPC traffic
 * and the dialog the user had open in A is still open when they
 * return.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  - Switch away from project X: `snapshotProject(X)` captures the
 *    relevant slices of the live stores into the in-memory map.
 *  - Switch in to project Y: `restoreProject(Y)` writes those slices
 *    back into the stores in one set() call per store and returns
 *    `true`. Caller skips the usual loadBoard/loadBacklog/loadConfig
 *    + hard-reset path.
 *  - Live mutations of project Y (slice writes, IPC pushes for the
 *    current project) flow into the live stores normally; the next
 *    `snapshotProject(Y)` will capture them.
 *  - Cross-project agent pushes (e.g. an MCP-created task in a
 *    background project) call `invalidateProject(thatProjectId)` so
 *    the next switch to it bypasses the cache and refetches.
 *  - PROJECT_DELETE on main calls `dropProject(id)` here via the
 *    delete handler echo so we don't leak entries.
 *
 * HMR preservation mirrors the `transientSessions` pattern in
 * session-store.ts: the cache map is stashed in `import.meta.hot.data`
 * during `dispose` and restored on module re-evaluation. Without this,
 * every renderer HMR cycle would blow the cache and force a refetch on
 * the next switch, breaking dogfooding when the user is iterating on
 * App.tsx itself.
 *
 * Not cached deliberately:
 *  - Cross-project `sessions` list, `sessionActivity`, and
 *    `sessionActivityReason`. These already span projects and are kept
 *    fresh by incremental IPC pushes (`onStatus`, `onActivity`).
 *    Restoring them per-project would clobber the cross-project view
 *    used by the sidebar's activity badges.
 *  - Per-session usage and events maps (`sessionUsage`, `sessionEvents`).
 *    Keyed by sessionId rather than projectId; pushed incrementally;
 *    the existing reconcileCache merge in `syncSessions` handles them.
