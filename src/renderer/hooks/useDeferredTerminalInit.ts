/**
 * Defers a terminal host's initTerminal() until its container has real pixel
 * dimensions, onto a frame where no other terminal is being constructed.
 * Shared by TerminalTab and CommandTerminalPane (the same "cannot drift"
 * pattern as useTerminalRefit) because the deferral carries three load-bearing
 * behaviors at once:
 *
 * - The commit that mounts a pane already pays the panel subtree render;
 *   folding xterm construction (open + WebGL context + fit) into that same task
 *   produced a 40-60ms pointer-thread stall when a spawning session's pane
 *   mounted mid-drag (task #468). That construction was documented here as
 *   "~10ms"; measured later against the live app via the long-frame ring, it
 *   averages ~75ms and peaks at 130ms, of which the WebGL context alone is
 *   13-29ms on a COLD first context and 7.4-9.6ms once the GPU process is warm.
 *   The deferral matters more than the original estimate implied. For the
 *   per-phase split of one init (and how much of it a reused terminal could
 *   skip), see the `init-timing` trace in useTerminal.ts's initTerminal.
 * - StrictMode's mount -> unmount -> remount constructs ONE terminal instead
 *   of two: the first mount's cleanup cancels its scheduled init before it
 *   ever runs. The synchronous init CommandTerminalPane hand-rolled instead
 *   built a throwaway xterm whose geometry-changing work raced the survivor
 *   through the settle pipeline (observed live: 'joined' twice, zero-wait,
 *   'no-tui-marker' twice per open).
 * - A display:none container (an inactive tab) has no dimensions yet; the
 *   ResizeObserver re-schedules the init when they arrive.
 *
 * The frame the init lands on comes from the SHARED queue in
 * terminal-init-queue.ts, not from a per-host requestAnimationFrame. A per-host
 * frame is the same frame for every host that mounted in the same commit, which
 * is how a 350ms block gets built out of three 120ms inits. One per frame caps
 * the worst block at one terminal's cost.
 *
 * The imperative core lives in runDeferredTerminalInit, exported so
 * tests/unit/deferred-terminal-init.test.ts asserts the contract against the
 * REAL code (this project's vitest has no DOM environment to render the hook
 * in; earlier coverage replicated the effect body and could drift).
 *
 * onInit/onCleanup are read through refs, so hosts may pass inline closures:
 * the effect re-runs only when initTerminal or the ref identity changes,
 * exactly as TerminalTab's inline effect always did. Note initTerminal is
 * NOT stable across settings changes (useTerminal rebuilds it on font/color
 * option changes) - a pre-existing quirk both hosts shared before the
 * extraction: the cleanup resets the flag and the next frame re-inits.
