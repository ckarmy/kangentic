/**
 * Pick a folder and open it as a project, in one step.
 *
 * There is deliberately no confirmation dialog between the folder picker and the board.
 * Everything it used to ask has a better answer than asking:
 *
 * - Git is set up rather than offered. Kangentic runs every task on its own branch in its
 *   own worktree, so a project without git is a broken project; `git init` creates `.git`
 *   and touches nothing else. A folder already covered by a repo (its own or a parent's)
 *   is left alone - see ensureGitRepo, which will not nest a repo inside someone else's.
 * - The name is the folder's own name, and the sidebar renames it in place any time.
 * - The default agent is step 1 of the onboarding walkthrough, which opens on the board
 *   immediately after this. Asking here would ask the same question twice.
 *
 * Re-picking a folder that is already a project just opens it - that is what someone
 * choosing it again is asking for.
 *
 * Failing to set git up never blocks the open. Being unable to run `git init` is a reason
 * to warn, not a reason to lock someone out of their own folder, so the board loads and a
 * toast explains what it costs.
