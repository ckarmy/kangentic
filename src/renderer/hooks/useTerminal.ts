 * - `parked`: this terminal is off-view; it must not reshape a grid it is not

 * - `replay-in-flight`: the replay's own fit + resize settle the dims; its
 *   resize's echo then self-filters as in-sync.

 * Should a finished replay be thrown away and re-issued, because the frame it

 * fitted to the container. Those two numbers are supposed to be the same, and
 * every mechanism that makes them differ has the same signature: the width
 * moves across the replay's own async gap, so the write lands at one width and
 * the refit that follows reports another. The frame is then hard-wrapped, and
 * nothing later repairs it - which is the whole reason this exists rather than
 * trusting the refit. Pure and exported for unit tests (precedent:
 * resolvePtyEchoReassert above).
 *
 * Guard order is load-bearing, most-specific first, so the trace names the REAL
 * reason rather than whichever mechanical guard was checked first:
 * - `unknown-width`: the terminal went away mid-replay; there is nothing to judge.
 * - `width-held`: the common case. The write and the grid agree, so the frame is
 *   correct and the budget is refunded by the caller.
 * - `normal-buffer`: xterm REFLOWS the normal buffer on resize, so a frame
 *   written narrow there has already re-wrapped itself correctly and a re-issue
 *   would be pure churn. Only the ALTERNATE buffer (a full-screen agent TUI) is
 *   never reflowed, and that is exactly where a stale width is permanent.
 *   Caveat, accepted: a GEOMETRY-GATED non-alt session (one whose byte ring
 *   spans a resize - see PtyBufferManager.getReplaySnapshot) replays a
 *   serialized frame whose hard-positioned TUI rows do not fully reflow, so
 *   the premise is weaker there. The renderer cannot tell the shapes apart
 *   (the payload is a bare string), the exposure window is one reload-time
 *   width race, and the very next reload refetches a frame serialized at the
 *   current PTY width - so this stays an accept rather than an IPC widening.
 * - `attempt-cap`: the budget is spent. Accepting a visibly wrong frame is worse
 *   than one more round trip but far better than an unbounded loop.
 *
 * SCOPE: wired into reloadScrollback only. initTerminal's mount replay has the
 * same structural gap (its post-write refit at `phase: 'after-replay'` can also
 * report a different width) but usually not the same exposure: its fit runs
 * after the WebGL attach, and it sends a real resize, so main serializes at the
 * width it fitted to. The exception is a mount taken while the page is already
 * at WEBGL_ATTACH_BUDGET: attachWebglRenderer starts that terminal SUSPENDED, so
 * the mount fit measures the DOM cell, and the coordinator's next plan can
 * promote it to WebGL mid-replay. Widening this to the mount path is
 * deliberately left undone rather than assumed unnecessary.

   * Discard the bytes the incoming queue is HOLDING, because the sample that

   *
   * A replay is a snapshot of main's ring at a single instant, but the queue
   * has been holding (`shouldHold`, not dropping) every byte main flushed
   * while the replay was in flight - and those bytes PREDATE the sample.
   * Kicking them after the replay writes an obsolete frame ON TOP of the fresh
   * one, and a TUI only sends differential updates afterwards, so the terminal
   * stays desynced until the next SIGWINCH. That is the "opens showing the
   * previous pane's frame, fixed by resizing" bug: a task detail opening on a
   * session at the bottom panel's 14 rows replayed the correct 48-row repaint,
   * then repainted the 14-row frame over it from the held queue.
   *
   * Everything main flushed to this renderer before the getScrollback REPLY is
   * by construction inside `scrollback`, whichever shape the sample takes. A
   * byte replay: main appends to its ring and its pending buffer from the same
   * bytes, clears the pending buffer at sample time, and IPC replies are
   * ordered against the flush stream. A parsed-grid frame (an alt-screen or
   * geometry-gated session's sample, PtyBufferManager.getReplaySnapshot):
   * every byte fed before the sample is baked into the frame (the serialize
   * is atomic with the parser's flush barrier), bytes racing the sample ride
   * the reply as an appended tail, and main holds the session's flush ticks
   * for the sample's duration so none of those bytes can arrive here ahead of
   * the reply. Main's
   * half of the double-delivery guard has always been there; this is the
   * renderer's half, for the bytes main can no longer recall.
   *
   * Called in the same microtask as the resolve, so no post-sample flush (a
   * separate macrotask) can be caught by it. That rests on the resize reply
   * settling FIRST: it is invoked first and handled synchronously on main (or
   * pre-resolved under skipResize), so Promise.all resolves off the scrollback
   * reply. If that ever inverted, Promise.all would resolve a macrotask later
   * and this could discard a genuine post-sample flush.
   *
   * Skipped when there is nothing to replay - a suppressed or failed read
   * leaves the held bytes as the only copy. A resolve with no terminal needs no
   * case of its own: the queue's own drain discards when getTerminal() is null.

    // 120ms and is the biggest script in most of the frames it lands in - and a
