/**
 * Reports a host's task-detail ownership to main by DERIVING it from that host's
 * window store, on every change.
 *
 * This is the single reporter for `taskDetailOwnership.syncOwned`, and it replaces
 * the per-host claim/release bookkeeping both hosts used to keep (the board's
 * `claimedRef` map, the monitor's `claimedAnchors` set). Incremental bookkeeping
 * could lose a release and strand a claim in main, which presented as a task
 * answering `focused-existing` for a window that no longer existed anywhere: every
 * attempt to open it focused nothing, silently, and the task stayed unopenable until
 * the renderer reloaded. A full-set report cannot strand anything, because the report
 * IS the state.
 *
 * Two subtleties that are easy to get wrong, both load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Mount this where the RENDERER lives, not inside the layer.** A layer that
 *    unmounts while its windows remain (the monitor's layer unmounts on close and on
 *    detach, and its window store deliberately survives) would stop reporting and
 *    stop hearing `DETAIL_CLOSE_HERE` - a phantom that outlives the surface, which is
 *    the bug class this exists to remove. Ownership follows the window STORE, which
 *    outlives the subtree. This is deliberately unlike `useWindowSessionClaims`,
 *    which gates on `isLayerMounted` because an unmounted layer really has no xterm.
 *
 * 2. **Abstain rather than report empty when the set cannot be derived.** An empty
 *    report is a destructive statement ("I host nothing"), so a host that merely does
 *    not know yet must send nothing and let main keep its last-known state, which the
 *    next real report corrects.
