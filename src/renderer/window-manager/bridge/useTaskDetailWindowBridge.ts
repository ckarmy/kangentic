/**
 * Bridges the renderer's single "which task detail is open" signal
 * (`session-store.detailTaskId`) to a managed window. Every existing entry point
 * (card click, context Edit, search palette, session-event notification, the
 * terminal panel double-click, project-switch restore) already calls
 * `setDetailTaskId`; this hook turns that into an `openWindow` so none of them
 * needed to learn about the window store. It also mirrors a window close back to
 * the signal so persistence and re-open logic stay consistent.
 *
 * Ownership: the signal does NOT open a window directly any more. It asks MAIN
 * where the detail should go (`taskDetailOwnership.requestOpen`), and a window
 * mounts only when main pushes `onOpenHere` back to THIS renderer. That is what
 * enforces "a task's detail can never be open twice" across renderers: a pop-out
 * is a separate renderer with its own stores, so neither host can see the other's
 * windows, and only main can arbitrate. The two rules live in
 * `src/main/task-detail/detail-owner-registry.ts` - deliberately not duplicated
 * here.
 *
 * Multi-window: opening a DIFFERENT task's detail opens a second window (windows
 * are modeless and stack); the prior window stays open. `detailTaskId` tracks the
 * most-recently-opened detail (for focus + persistence). Terminal ownership is a
 * per-session set (`dialogSessionIds`), so each window owns its own session
 * without colliding; the bottom panel steps aside while any window is open.
 *
 * Mounted once by `WindowLayer`.
