/**
 * The single snap-preview rectangle. Rendered once inside the overlay; its DOM
 * element is driven imperatively by `snap-preview-controller` during a drag (no
 * React re-render). Hidden by default; shown when an edge-snap or drag-to-dock
 * zone is armed.
 *
 * The box GLIDES between positions/sizes via a short CSS transition, so fast
 * mouse movement that flips the armed zone (left -> top -> bottom, or pane to
 * pane) reads as a smooth morph instead of a jump. The transition only animates
 * while the box is shown: a CSS transition never fires on a change from
 * `display:none`, so the box still APPEARS instantly at the target (no glide-in
 * from a stale spot) and only animates as the armed zone changes mid-drag. It is
 * a lone overlay element, so this is pure paint - no terminal reflow.
