/**
 * Where the dictation chip sits: under the thing the words are actually landing
 * in.
 *
 * It used to anchor to the focused WINDOW and centre horizontally, which put it
 * in the worst possible spot for a split task-detail window. Measured on a real
 * one: frame 538..2022, terminal pane 539..1280, Browser pane 1281..2021 - so
 * the window's centre, 1280, IS the split seam. The chip straddled the divider
 * whichever side the user was dictating into, and its bottom edge landed on the
 * Browser pane's own Clear / Inspect controls.
 *
 * THE TWO ANCHORS.
 *
 * A text input is exact: it is a DOM node and its rect is the field.
 *
 * A terminal anchors to the bottom band of its PANE - the agent's input box -
 * and not to its caret. The caret was tried first, on the measured finding that
 * xterm keeps `.xterm-helper-textarea` positioned on it for IME composition -
 * which is true, and not dependable: an agent TUI hides the cursor, and with it
 * hidden xterm parks that element away from the caret entirely, then snaps it
 * back the moment input arrives. The chip slid across the pane at the start of
 * every utterance as a result. A stable band beats a precise-but-jumpy point,
 * and a TUI keeps its input box at the bottom regardless, so the band lands
 * where the caret would have been anyway - see `TERMINAL_INPUT_RESERVE_PX`.
 *
 * NOTHING MOVES DURING AN UTTERANCE except the pane itself. The anchor is
 * re-measured every frame so a window drag or resize still carries the chip
 * along; what it no longer does is chase a caret.
