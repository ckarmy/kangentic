/**
 * WebGL renderer attachment with context-loss recovery and a page-wide
 * attachment budget.
 *
 * xterm's WebGL renderer is 10-50x faster than its DOM fallback for output
 * bursts. The GPU can drop the WebGL context (a GPU process crash, a driver
 * reset, memory pressure). blink restores a lost context on its own within
 * about a second whenever Chromium allows it, and the addon fires
 * `onContextLoss` only when no restore arrived inside 3s. That callback
 * therefore almost always means Chromium is REFUSING the context, not that the
 * GPU is gone, and the refusal is time-bounded (see the comment above
 * `DEFAULT_RETRY_DELAYS_MS`). This module re-acquires on a backoff schedule
 * whose tail outlasts that refusal and never stops trying: a terminal on the
 * DOM renderer for any reason other than a deliberate budget suspend always has
 * a retry armed. It used to stop after two retries and latch the terminal onto
 * the DOM renderer for the rest of the session (Sentry DESKTOP-T: a GPU process
 * crash-looping once a minute burned both retries inside Chromium's block, and
 * the terminal never came back even after the GPU was healthy again).
 *
 * The budget exists because Chromium caps live WebGL contexts per page (~16)
 * and silently drops the OLDEST when a new one is created - which lands here as
 * a context loss on some other terminal. With windowed terminals the page can
 * host far more xterms than the cap, so attachments above `WEBGL_ATTACH_BUDGET`
 * start suspended, and a coordinator (useFocusedSessionsSync) applies an LRU
 * plan via `applyWebglAttachmentPlan` to keep the most-recently-focused
 * terminals on WebGL. A budget-driven suspend is NOT a context loss: it never
 * touches `contextLossCount`, does not advance the retry schedule, and the
 * terminal re-attaches on its next `resume()`.

 * Re-acquisition schedule, sized against Chromium's 3D-API block rather than

 *
 * Chromium (content/browser/gpu/gpu_data_manager_impl_private.cc, read at
 * 146.0.7680.166, the Chromium inside Electron 41.1.1) records one block entry
 * for the page's domain every time a live WebGL context is lost to a GPU
 * process crash or a driver reset, and answers `getContext('webgl2')` with null
 * while TWO or more entries are younger than `kBlockedDomainExpirationPeriod`
 * (2 minutes): "Allow one context loss per domain, so block if there are two or
 * more." The domain key is the URL host (empty for the file:// page production
 * loads), so every terminal on the page is blocked together. A single loss is
 * restored by blink itself within a second, so `onContextLoss` (fired only when
 * no restore arrived in 3s) almost always means the SECOND loss inside two
 * minutes, and the block lifts when the OLDER entry ages out: up to 120s after
 * the second-most-recent crash, which is no later than about 117s after the
 * addon's callback. No retry inside that window can succeed, which is why the
 * old 2s/10s pair always failed in exactly the case it ran in.
 *
 * Cumulative: 2, 12, 42, 72, 132, 252, 372... seconds. The first two slots are
 * the original transient calibration; 132s is the first attempt guaranteed past
 * the block when no further crash extends it; after that the last slot repeats
 * at the block's own period. A probe while blocked is a sync round trip to the
 * browser process that returns null, sub-millisecond and no GPU work, so the
 * unending tail costs nothing in an environment where WebGL never comes back
 * (headless, blocklisted GPU). The numbers are not load-bearing: if Chromium's
 * expiry changes, recovery slips by at most one tail slot.
 *
 * Do not "fix" this by calling `app.disableDomainBlockingFor3DAPIs()` in main.
 * If WebGL use is what trips the driver, the block is the only thing pacing the
 * crashes: without it the terminal re-trips the driver every second, and
 * Chromium's own crash counter (3 in 5 minutes) drops the whole app to software
 * compositing. With the block, each successful re-attach can still yield a
 * crash pair in that environment and the counter still converges the same way
 * over a few cycles; the old latch did not prevent that either, it only left
 * the terminal slow afterwards.
