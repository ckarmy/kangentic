/**
 * Session-update coalescer.
 *
 * Single funnel for every session-store push mutation that can re-render a
 * board TaskCard (usage, activity-log events, spawn progress, session status,
 * activity state, first output, exit, idle-timeout). It does two jobs:
 *
 *   1. Coalesce. High-frequency usage/event pushes are batched into one
 *      microtask flush, so N pushes that arrive in the same event-loop turn
 *      cause one React render instead of N. (React 19 auto-batches the set()
 *      calls in flush.)
 *   2. Drag gate, for RELOADS ONLY. Session pushes are NOT held during a drag:
 *      usage, activity events, spawn progress, status, first output, and exit all
 *      apply immediately, because a card that stops reporting while an unrelated
 *      task is dragged reads as the app hanging, and a re-render never disturbs
 *      dnd-kit anyway (droppables register in a `useEffect(..., [id])` and the
 *      default measuring strategy is WhileDragging, so only a card HEIGHT change
 *      re-measures, and every card is height-stable by construction). What IS
 *      held is a background-originated full reload (`enqueueReload`): an
 *      agent-driven `loadBoard()` / `loadBacklog()` / `loadConfig()` landing
 *      mid-drag replaces the sortable item set, and `SortableContext` compares
 *      `items` as id strings by value, so a mid-gesture reconcile re-measures the
 *      lane and disables transforms, snapping displaced cards. Reloads are parked
 *      while a drag is active and flushed once on drag end, deduped by key so N
 *      agent events that each requested a reload collapse to one. When idle they
 *      run immediately. User-initiated reloads (drop, detail-dialog actions,
 *      project switch, confirm dialogs, drag-cancel) do NOT route through here;
 *      they already fire at or after drag end. The optimistic move/drop never
 *      routes through here either (it lives in board-store).
 *   3. Drag-end signal. `onBoardDragEnd` lets another renderer subsystem defer
 *      its own expensive work for the length of a gesture and resume when the
 *      gate clears, including via the watchdog and blur backstops below.
 *
 * Usage and events keep their dedicated batch store actions (`batchUpdateUsage`
 * / `batchAddEvents`) for efficient last-write-wins / append semantics. The
 * side-effect-bearing handlers (auto-focus, notifications, auto-name) run their
 * thunk synchronously in `enqueueSessionUpdate`; `pendingThunks` is retained as
 * the documented mechanism should a hold ever be reintroduced, and it flushes in
 * arrival order so lifecycle ordering would stay correct (`upsertSession` clears
 * `spawnProgress[taskId]`).
 *
 * HMR: a board drag never survives a module reload (every `<DndContext>`
 * re-keys via `hmrGeneration`), and App.tsx's `vite:afterUpdate` handler
 * re-fetches authoritative state from the main process, which supersedes any
 * buffered renderer-side push. So on HMR we DISCARD buffers and reset the gate
 * rather than preserve or flush them - `resetCoalescerForHmr()` is called from
 * that handler. This mirrors the manual HMR discipline in `auto-name-scheduler.ts`.

 * ResizeObserver while dragging that re-measures every card below the one that
 * resized. That is now prevented at the source: the activity mark is height-neutral
 * by construction, and TaskCard's running-state spinner is structurally identical
 * to `ContextUsageFooter`, so a resolving model name no longer grows the card.
 *
 * `pendingThunks` and the drain in `flush()` are retained: `endBoardDrag()` still
