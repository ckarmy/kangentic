/**
 * The Agent Monitor's implementation of `TaskDetailHostValue`.
 *
 * The board's host reads the live board / config / project stores, because its
 * task always belongs to the open project. A monitor row can belong to ANY
 * project, so this host resolves the same values from the per-project bundle
 * (`monitor.getTaskDetail`) instead, and its mutations go straight to the
 * project-stamped IPC.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT reusing the board store's actions: those apply an optimistic
 * local update to the OPEN project's task list, which for a background project's
 * task would either do nothing or corrupt the wrong board. The IPC underneath is
 * the same in both hosts (`tasks.update` / `move` / `delete` / `unarchive`, all
 * of which already take an explicit projectId per
 * .claude/rules/project-scoped-ipc.md); only the local echo differs, and here the
 * echo is a bundle refetch.
 *
 * One bundle per open task, keyed by (projectId, taskId), refetched on the
 * monitor's own change push so a rename or column move made elsewhere lands here
 * too.
