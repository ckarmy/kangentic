 * split is most of what makes this readable:
 *
 *   Row 1 - "what am I looking at": the scope (project) and the primary lens
 *           (layout), as prominent pill controls, with the live counts anchored
 *           opposite them.
 *   Row 2 - "how is it sliced": the quieter grouping / ordering / filter
 *           controls, as muted ButtonGroups.
 *
 * The first cut put all seven controls on one line as three native <select>s, a
 * checkbox, an icon strip and a search box, which is a lot of different shapes to
 * scan through. Same controls here, same primitives as the dashboard
 * (ButtonGroup, the rounded metric-toggle pill), just sorted into tiers.
