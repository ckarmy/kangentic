 * frame, so deriving the set from the clip mounts too little. Upstream's own example: `running-loop`
 * plays step-a and step-b but mounts step-a, step-b and rest, and mounting only the played pair
 * renders nothing at all once motion is off.
 *
 * `restFrame` is unioned in unconditionally rather than trusted to appear in every sequence's
 * `mountFrames`, because the base `.overseer-frame--rest { visibility: visible }` rule needs that
 * div to exist for the mascot to render at all.
 *
 * Names with no `FRAME_URLS` entry are dropped: this component imports only the frames its three
 * supported sequences use, so an upstream addition must not render `<img src={undefined}>`.
 *
 * Takes the contract as a parameter rather than closing over `CONTRACT` so the three drift branches
 * above (rest unioned in, unknown name dropped, sequence absent) can be pinned against fabricated
 * contracts in `tests/unit/overseer-mascot-frames.test.ts`. None of them fires against the
 * installed package, so without that they would read as untested defensive code.

 * - `prefers-reduced-motion` sets `animation: none`, so no `animationend` ever
 *   fires and the mascot simply rests on the canonical frame - the correct
 *   resting rendering, reached by doing nothing.
 * - The app's own "Animations" off toggle (`.no-motion`) zeroes
 *   animation-duration instead, so the intro ends immediately and the idle
 *   sequence also runs at 0s. Both rest on the canonical frame because the
 *   shipped CSS emits no `animation-fill-mode`. That path does NOT rely on
 *   `animationend`, which newer Chromium no longer fires for a 0s animation;
 *   the effect below reads the computed duration and hands off directly.
 * - At most one Overseer per view (sprite-drafting convention).
