/**
 * Keep a dragged row inside the pane's own scroller, and on its vertical axis.
 *
 * Without this, dragging a row downward RAN AWAY: the pane scrolled itself into
 * empty space and the row followed it off the bottom. The cause is a feedback
 * loop rather than a stray setting. A transformed element still contributes to
 * its ancestor's scrollable overflow, so translating a row down grows the
 * scroller's `scrollHeight`; dnd-kit's auto-scroll sees room to scroll, scrolls
 * toward the pointer, which lets the row translate further, which grows
 * `scrollHeight` again. Measured in a preview: the pane sat at scrollHeight 344
 * against clientHeight 344, not scrollable at all, and a single 400px transform
 * took it to 484 and made it scrollable. The drag was manufacturing the very
 * overflow it then chased.
 *
 * Clamping the transform breaks the loop at its source: the row cannot leave the
 * visible box, so it cannot invent overflow. Genuine auto-scroll still works on
 * a list long enough to really overflow, because then the room to scroll exists
 * whether or not anything is being dragged.
 *
 * This is `restrictToFirstScrollableAncestor` plus `restrictToVerticalAxis` from
 * `@dnd-kit/modifiers`, written out rather than installed. The package is not a
 * dependency here, and a new one to avoid twelve lines is a bad trade.
 *
 * The x axis is pinned rather than clamped. This is a vertical list, sideways
 * travel means nothing to it, and letting x drift would grow horizontal overflow
 * the same way.
 *
 * The bound is the row's OWN GROUP, intersected with that scroller. A row can
 * only ever land in its own group, so letting it travel past the heading into
 * the other one advertised a drop that was never going to happen: it sat over
 * On exit's rows looking like it belonged there and then snapped back. Stopping
 * it at its group's last row makes the reachable range and the legal range the
 * same thing. The intersection is what keeps the scroller half honest, since a
 * group longer than the pane would otherwise let the row leave the visible box
 * and start the overflow loop again.
