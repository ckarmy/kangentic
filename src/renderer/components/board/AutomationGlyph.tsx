/**
 * The column header's automation mark: a `Zap` and the number of automations
 * that will RUN when a task enters or leaves this column.
 *
 * Hidden at zero, with no dimmed variant. A column with nothing to run has
 * nothing to say, and a permanently-dim glyph on most columns would be noise
 * the eye has to learn to skip.
 *
 * The count is the SAME derivation the rail and the All columns table use
 * (`selectAutomationCounts`), so a column can never read 5 here and 3 there. A
 * switched-off or blocked row is not counted: this answers "what happens when a
 * task moves", and an off row is visible and fixable one click away in Board
 * setup.
