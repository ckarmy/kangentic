              {/* Row 2, column 1: THE ADDRESS. ONE control for every mode - the
                  same input, read-only where the address is resolved for you
                  (hosted, and the dev-only local) and editable where you supply
                  it (custom). So the section has a single skeleton, picker over
                  address and probe button over verdict, whose only difference
                  between modes is whether the address box accepts typing.

                  readOnly, NOT disabled. This box replaced a resolved-URL Pill
                  whose text could be selected and copied, and a disabled input
                  can be neither focused nor selected - it would take away the
                  ability to copy the relay address for no gain. readOnly also
                  announces itself correctly to a screen reader. `disabled` is
                  still wired, but to the MASTER TOGGLE, which is a different
                  question ("is the bridge on") from mode.

                  The editable form used to live in its own SettingRow BELOW this
                  whole row, which read backwards: the probe verdict and its
                  failure reason both appeared above the input being tested, that
                  reason was stranded under an empty cell ~400px from its own
                  chip, and the SettingRow put a second heading and an indent rule
                  inside a section that already has a heading. Its description
                  only restated the dependency ("when Relay above is set to Custom
                  Relay") that showing the field solely in that mode already made
                  self-evident.

                  No visible label, deliberately: the box sits directly under the
                  picker at the same width, so its position says which relay it is
                  the address OF, and the placeholder demonstrates the required
                  format. `aria-label` carries both facts for screen readers. */}

                {/* Shield ONLY for the Kangentic-operated relay, which is what
                    makes it worth drawing: unlike the "Official" chip this
                    replaces, it has a real contrast case, since the same box in
                    local or custom mode shows none. 14px inside a 34px field,
                    where a shield is legible - the chip that failed was trying to
                    draw one at 11px. aria-hidden because the fact is in the
                    input's own accessible name; the title is a supplementary
                    affordance for sighted users, never the sole carrier.

                    The title lives on a wrapping span because lucide's props omit
                    `title`, and that span deliberately does NOT carry
                    pointer-events-none: it would suppress the hover the title
                    needs. The cost is a 14px dead zone over the field's left
                    padding, which is free here - the mark only ever renders in
                    hosted mode, where the field is read-only and there is no
