 * Interaction is the WAI-ARIA radiogroup pattern, not a row of buttons: one tab

   * anywhere - it shows up as a visibly wider gap on the trailing edge than the
   * 2px inset above and below.
   *
   * The row is the positioning context and carries no border or padding, so its
   * border box, padding box, and content box coincide: the thumb's containing
   * block origin is exactly `rowRect.left`, with no correction term.
   *
   * The catch, and the bug this exists to stop: `getBoundingClientRect` reports
   * TRANSFORMED geometry, and every dialog in the app enters at `scale(0.96)`
   * (`dialog-content-in`). A measurement taken during that animation sizes the
   * thumb 4% small, and NOTHING ever corrects it, because the only correction
   * here is a ResizeObserver and ResizeObserver reports the LAYOUT box, which a
   * transform does not change - so no callback fires when the animation ends.
   * The wrong thumb is permanent for the life of the dialog.
   *
   * Measured in a preview: a When control sampled 67.89 against an
   * `offsetWidth` of 71, a ratio of 0.9562, and stayed 2.84px narrow. It looked
   * intermittent because what varies is whether the layout effect lands before
   * or during the animation's first frame.
   *
   * The untransformed width comes from `getComputedStyle`, so the ratio between
   * it and the rect IS the ancestor scale, and dividing it out makes the
   * measurement scale-invariant. `offsetWidth` was tried for this and is not
   * good enough: it rounds to an integer, so on a 142px row it cannot see a
   * scale closer to 1 than about 0.35%, which left the thumb 0.31px narrow when
   * the retry below stopped a frame early. The computed width is fractional and
   * exact, so the loop can run until the transform is genuinely gone.
