# Devtools

Dev-only inspection bridge for the kangentic `/preview` instance. Lets an
agent (Claude Code in the dev session, an external MCP client, a
Playwright spec) query the running app's state and drive its UI.

## Boundary

This whole tree is excluded from production builds at compile time via
the esbuild `define` constant `__KANGENTIC_DEV__`.

- In dev (`npm start`, `npm run dev`): `__KANGENTIC_DEV__` is `true`.
  Each of the seven product hook lines that touch this tree resolves to
  the real implementation.
- In prod (`npm run package`, `npm run make`): `__KANGENTIC_DEV__` is
  `false`. Dead-code elimination drops both the `import` statement and
  the body of every `if (__KANGENTIC_DEV__) { ... }` guard, so this
  folder never reaches the production binary.

Product code may NOT import from this folder unguarded. The check is
mechanical: every entry from `src/main/`, `src/preload/`, `src/renderer/`,
or `src/shared/` into `src/devtools/` must be inside an
`if (__KANGENTIC_DEV__)` block (or, for renderer JSX, the equivalent
`{__KANGENTIC_DEV__ && <X />}` form). The reverse direction (devtools →
product) is unrestricted.

## Layout

                               ring. NOTE: the ring is inert under Vite dev - see the KNOWN GAP
                               block on installRenderTracker before trusting an empty result

```

## Subsystems

### Discovery (`main/lockfile.ts`, `main/instances.ts`)

Each running preview writes a per-worktree lockfile at
`<projectRoot>/.kangentic/preview.lock` recording the bound HTTP port.
External tools (the agent's MCP client, other preview instances, Playwright
specs) discover instances by walking every registered project's worktrees
and reading the lockfiles. Stale lockfiles are detected via PID liveness
(`isAlive(pid)` from the existing process-tree probe).

### HTTP bridge (`main/inspection-server.ts`)

Localhost-only HTTP server on a random port. Endpoints wrap product
diagnostics (`/logs`, `/crashes`, `/process-metrics`, `/ipc-log`),
expose live engine + renderer state (`/engine-state`, `/renderer-state`,
`/store-state`), serve screenshots + DOM (`/screenshot`, `/dom`,
`/query-all`, `/bounding-box`, `/bounding-box-all`, etc.), and accept
interaction commands (`/click`, `/type`, `/keypress`, `/drag`, `/drop-files`,
`/wait`, `/script`, `/eval`). `/drop-files` is the one OS-level input: it
dispatches a real file drop (`Input.dispatchDragEvent` with `files`) so the
page's `dataTransfer.files` carry path-backed `File` objects, which is what a
file-drop feature needs and no in-page `new File()` can fake. `POST /quit` runs Electron's real quit path; it is what
`scripts/dev.js` calls when a stop file asks it to shut a preview down, so a
`worktree-preview.js --stop` no longer force-kills the app past its
synchronous cleanup.

### CDP wrapper (`main/cdp.ts`)

Calls `webContents.debugger.attach('1.3')` on the main window and
exposes typed wrappers around the DevTools-Protocol calls used by the
HTTP bridge: `Page.captureScreenshot`, `DOM.querySelector` /
`getOuterHTML` / `getBoxModel`, `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` /
`dispatchKeyEvent` / `dispatchDragEvent`, `Runtime.evaluate`,
`Console.messageAdded`.

### Renderer mirror (`renderer/state-mirror.ts`, `renderer/store-state.ts`)

`buildPreviewSnapshot()` aggregates every Zustand store plus a few ring
buffers (toasts shown, dialogs opened, IPC errors). Installed on
`window.__kangenticPreviewSnapshot` so the inspection server can read
it via `Runtime.evaluate('JSON.stringify(window.__kangenticPreviewSnapshot())')`.

For reads beyond the fixed snapshot, `readStoreState(name, path)` (backed
by the `PREVIEW_STORES` registry, with the pure path-walk + sanitization
in `store-state.ts`) is installed on `window.__kangenticPreviewStoreState`
and serves `/store-state`. `PREVIEW_STORES` is the single place a new
Zustand store must be registered to become readable; the
`devtools-preview-stores` unit test fails CI if a `*-store.ts` is missing.

`renderer/lag-recorder.ts` holds the two dev-only performance rings: the
event-loop lag sampler (WHEN the thread blocked) and the
`long-animation-frame` ring with per-script attribution (WHAT ran). Both
are served by `/event-loop-lag`.

Fiber walking lives in `preload/react-fiber-walker.ts`, not here: it rides
`__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` to walk fibers from a DOM node and to
maintain a ring buffer of recent commits (via `onCommitFiberRoot`). Read
the KNOWN GAP block on `installRenderTracker` before trusting an empty
`recentRenders` result - under a Vite dev server the ring never attaches,
so `[]` means "not instrumented", not "no React work happened".

### MCP tools (`mcp/preview-tools.ts`, `mcp/register.ts`)

Every dev-only tool uses the `kangentic_devtools_*` prefix to keep them
distinct from the product-tier tools that ship in all builds. Each tool
talks to the inspection server over HTTP (the bridge could be in this
process or a different running preview instance - discovery picks the
right port).

## Adding a new tool

1. Add the new endpoint to `main/inspection-server.ts`.
2. Wire its implementation through `main/cdp.ts` if it needs DOM /
   Page / Input / Runtime / Console; or through a fresh module in
   `main/` if it talks to filesystem / process state.
3. Register a `kangentic_devtools_*` tool in `mcp/preview-tools.ts`
   that calls the new endpoint and formats the result.
4. Update this README's subsystem list and the architecture plan in
   `docs/devtools.md` (when that doc lands).

Both gates apply to every tool:
- `developer.previewInspectionServer` (master switch - lockfile + bridge)
- `developer.previewEvalEnabled` (extra gate for arbitrary-code surfaces:
  `eval`, the `script` `eval` step, `inject_session_event`,
  `pty-input.bytes`). Read tools built on fixed server-generated
  expressions (`/renderer-state`, `/store-state`, `/query-all`,
  `/bounding-box-all`, `/react-component`) are NOT eval-gated - the
  selector / store name / path is interpolated as a JSON string literal,
  never executed as caller-supplied code.
