/**
 * MANUAL MEASUREMENT SCRIPT - not wired to CI or any npm script.
 *
 * Measures, per agent CLI, how long it takes for a submitted user turn to
 * appear in the session history file that agent's parser resolves. This is the
 * gate for implementing `getSubmissionVerifier('command-injection')`: a
 * verifier polls for ~2s and then declares failure, so an agent that flushes
 * its history on turn-end rather than on submit would read "never landed"
 * every time.
 *
 * That failure is not benign, which is the whole reason this script exists:
 *   - No verifier      -> outcome `unconfirmed`, escalation never fires.
 *   - Too-slow verifier -> false `failed` -> escalation -> session RESTART
 *                          that destroys live work.
 * A wrong verifier is worse than no verifier. Do not implement one for an
 * adapter whose latency was not measured here.
 *
 * HOW IT MEASURES
 * Rather than reimplement each agent's record shape (that is the verifier's
 * job, and is exactly what may be buggy), each probe embeds a unique nonce and
 * we measure when that nonce first appears in the history file. That is
 * agent-agnostic ground truth and stays honest even when the app's own
 * resolver is broken. The containing record is captured so the record shape
 * can be read off the report later.
 *
 * THE PAIRED-TRIAL DISCRIMINATOR (the load-bearing part)
 * A trivial prompt ends its turn in under a second, so a turn-end-flushed
 * history still reads sub-second and every agent looks like a PASS. Each agent
 * is therefore probed with BOTH a trivial prompt and one that forces a
 * multi-second turn. If append latency tracks turn duration, the agent flushes
 * at turn-end and FAILS the gate.
 *
 * OFFLINE MODE
 * `--offline` runs with credentials stripped. If the CLI appends the user turn
 * before calling the API, the probe costs no quota. But an unauthenticated run
 * has no turn to flush at turn-end, so a fast append there proves nothing:
 * offline can only ever yield "absent" (a negative) or "needs live
 * confirmation". Offline NEVER yields a PASS. The report enforces this.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs --agent codex
 *   node scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs --agent codex --offline
 *   node scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs --agent all --trials 3
 *   node scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs --list
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --agent <name|all>  agent to probe (required unless --list)
 *   --trials <n>        trials per case, default 3. Report uses the MAX.
 *   --offline           strip credentials; never produces a PASS
 *   --case <name>       run only one case: short | long | slash
 *   --keep              keep the temp workspace for inspection
 *   --timeout <ms>      per-probe appearance timeout, default 60000
 *   --out <path>        write the JSON report here
 *   --pattern <regex>   narrow the scan to the file the VERIFIER would read,
 *                       e.g. --agent qwen --pattern "^[0-9a-f-]+\.jsonl$"
 *   --workspace <dir>   run in this already-trusted directory instead of a fresh
 *                       temp one (skips Claude Code's workspace trust dialog);
 *                       never written to or removed. Not a directory a live
 *                       agent session runs in: the probes then share that
 *                       session's transcript directory and its writes
 *                       contaminate the latency (docs/command-injection.md)

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The bar, DERIVED from the delivery budget rather than picked.
 *
 * `submitKeystrokes` retries up to `MAX_SUBMIT_ATTEMPTS` (5) times, polling for
 * `VERIFY_WINDOW_MS` (400ms) after each Enter, so a submission has ~2000ms to
 * become visible before the outcome is `failed`. `sentAt` advances on every
 * retry, so a record written at Nms is caught by whichever attempt is in flight
 * when it lands - the agent does not have to beat a single 400ms window.
 *
 * The bar IS the budget, with no reserve, and that is a deliberate choice the
 * control forced. Two earlier attempts to hold reserve (1000ms, then 1500ms)
 * both failed CLAUDE - the reference implementation whose verifier ships and
 * works - at 1412ms and then 1876ms. Any bar that rejects the known-good
 * adapter is measuring the wrong thing, so the reserve had to go.
 *
 * Claude's control is BIMODAL: 775/791/779ms or 1812/1828/1876ms, nothing
 * between. That is a periodic flush being caught either side of its interval,
 * not jitter, so "typical" latency is meaningless here and only the upper mode
 * matters. It also means an adapter can sit at ~94% of budget and still work,
 * which is why the discriminators that matter are TURN-TRACKING and OUTRIGHT
 * MISSES, not a tidy millisecond cutoff.
 *
 * Re-run `--agent claude` after touching this constant. If the control does not
 * pass, the instrument is broken and no other verdict from it can be trusted.
