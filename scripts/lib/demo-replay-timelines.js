/**
 * The two timelines a recording carries besides its bytes, both derived from its own stream.
 *
 * A recording's raw bytes replay only into a terminal whose grid matches the one they were made
 * at: Windows ConPTY re-emits even Claude's classic renderer with absolute cursor positions, so
 * another grid lands two frames' text on one row. That grid is not something a page can promise.
 * It moves with the visitor's display scaling and with which monospace font their machine has,
 * and the board's bottom panel is 15 rows where a session recording is 37, which no font size can
 * reconcile.
 *
 * A serialized FRAME has no such problem. It reflows, so the same frame paints correctly into any
 * grid, and a 37-row frame in a 15-row panel simply shows its last 15 rows, which is what a
 * terminal scrolled to the bottom shows anyway. So every recording carries a timeline of frames
 * as well as its stream, and a terminal that cannot take the bytes plays the frames instead. Live
 * output at any size, on any machine, with no second recording.
 *
 * The peek timeline is the same idea for the Monitor: the displayed last lines and when they
 * changed, so a card moves even on a page with no terminal open at all.
 *
 * One replay produces both. Shared by scripts/capture-agent-scrollback.js (new recordings) and
 * scripts/backfill-demo-timelines.mjs (the ones already on disk), so the two cannot drift.
