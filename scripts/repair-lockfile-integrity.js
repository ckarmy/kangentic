/**
 * Restore `resolved` and `integrity` on every package-lock.json entry that lost them.
 *
 * Regenerating package-lock.json against a populated node_modules silently drops both
 * fields for every package already on disk: npm reads the installed version out of the
 * on-disk package.json, which since npm 7 carries no `_resolved` / `_integrity`, and
 * writes an entry with neither. Packages NOT on disk (wrong-platform optionals) are
 * resolved from the registry instead and keep full metadata, so the damage is invisible
 * unless you count. It happened here in 4de7b2e9 and cost 1009 of 1211 entries their
 * supply-chain verification, which `npm ci` then skipped in CI and in the signed release
 * build for two months.
 *
 * `npm install --package-lock-only` does NOT repair this: arborist has no reason to
 * re-fetch a manifest for a node whose pinned version already satisfies the range, so it
 * reports "up to date" and rewrites nothing. Hence this script.
 *
 * It is version-preserving by construction. Each entry keeps its pinned `version`; only
 * `resolved` and `integrity` are filled in, read from that exact version's registry
 * manifest. The manifest's own `name` and `version` are asserted against the entry before
 * anything is written, so a key-parsing slip cannot quietly swap one package's tarball
 * into another package's entry.
 *
 * Idempotent. Re-running it on a healthy lockfile reports nothing to do.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/repair-lockfile-integrity.js
