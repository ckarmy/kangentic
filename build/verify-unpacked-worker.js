/**
 * Release gate for every packaged utilityProcess worker forked from the
 * `app.asar.unpacked` tree (the embed worker, and the dictation worker added
 * for DESKTOP-X).
 *
 * Each such worker keeps its native/heavy dependency external, so at runtime
 * it resolves that package, and everything the package requires, with plain
 * Node resolution from real directories. A dependency that ships only inside
 * the asar is invisible to it, and the worker then dies at module load with
 * `Cannot find module` on every fork. That is exactly what shipped in 0.38.0
 * and 0.39.0 (DESKTOP-6, DESKTOP-H): `onnxruntime-common` and `sharp` were in
 * the asar and not in `asarUnpack`, and nothing in the build ever tried to
 * load the embed worker's closure from the unpacked tree.
 *
 * This gate does that load, with plain Node, against the tree electron-builder
 * just produced, once per worker (`build/afterPack.js` calls
 * `verifyUnpackedWorkerModules` once with each worker's `moduleNames`/
 * `probeDependencies` pair). Two things make it honest:
 *
 * - Resolution is FENCED to the unpacked root. The output directory sits under
 *   the repo, so an unfenced `require` would walk up into the repo's own
 *   `node_modules`, find every missing package there, and pass a tree that
 *   fails the moment it is installed anywhere else.
 * - It runs in a child `node`, not in electron-builder's process, so a native
 *   binding it loads (onnxruntime, sharp) cannot poison the build, and its
 *   stderr (the `Cannot find module` text) is what the thrown error carries.
 *
 * Node, not Electron: the fuse flip that disables `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` runs
 * in the same afterPack hook, and the failure class this guards is module
 * resolution, which does not depend on the runtime. Every release platform
 * builds on its native arch (see .github/workflows/release.yml), so the native
 * bindings load here too; an arch mismatch surfaces as a load failure, which
 * is the loud outcome .claude/rules/release-gates-fail-loudly.md asks for.
